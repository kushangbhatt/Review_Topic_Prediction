{"text":"McDonald's is McDonald's. This location was dead slow despite there being no one waiting for service. Cashier purposefully overcharged my friends because they were dunk. Horribly rude to do that."}
{"text":"A little disorganized, but I still got my food pretty fast.  It was tasty and although the place was very crowded, it was surprisingly clean."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the most raunchy McDonald's on the planet. The staff is slow and the customers are sketchy. Avoid when possible."}
{"text":"Same McDoonalds as everywhere. Cheap prices for non-healthy food but the service was UNBELIEVABLY slow. Not much room where to sit compared to other McDicks on top of it. The designer literally had no idea on how to take advantage of the room for a maximum of seating."}
{"text":"Worse Mc Donald's I have ever visited. \nWe ordered just French Fries on the automatic order board. \nThey got the orders on that system totally screwed up. We waited over half an hour for just a French fries. Totally ridiculous. Our number was 414 they were serving according to the board number 220 but it does not go by order how high or low the numbers are. It jumps all over the place. \nNo order or common sense what so ever. We should have ordered in the regular old fashion order line and not on the new boards. \nMy fault. \nDon't ever have to come back again."}
{"text":"This McDonald is really really and let me reiterate really show. The service is worse than what you see in the U.S. There's a long line and it takes forever to order you food, when you do order..heh have fun waiting. But honestly just by observing this mcdonalds, I'd say because it's understaffed. 3 people on the night shift?! The manager at this establishment needs to get his head together and hire more people to run this location."}
{"text":"Little road trip to Montreal was amazing, after our last night there while hanging out with a friend, drivinv around landed us at a downtown McDonald's.\n\nBy far the most disgusting dining room I've ever been to. Cold coffee, fruit and fiber muffin that was as hard as a brick. Might be almost as hard as Iron Man's body armor. I received a replacement muffin, but got a civics lesson on the coffee being cold because I ordered it with 2 milks. I'm sure she couldn't give an explanation for the bitter taste."}
{"text":"In the Village, right under the pink balls and next to 2 pok√©stops. This McDo has everything to offer.\n\nIt's a tad small but given the location it's only justified."}
{"text":"Eff you McDonalds, eff you! \n\nYou told me you had \"Real Fruit Smoothies\" that were blended to perfection and offered at a reasonable price. You drilled that idea in my head for weeks with your incessant advertising on the sides of buses and mile high billboards with pictures of creamy, fruity smoothies that made my mouth salivate instantly. You knew that I loved smoothies so much that I would go to great and dangerous lengths to obtain one of your so called \"Real Fruit Smoothies\". You knew that even though I loathed you and everything you stand for, that I would risk it all, risk everything to venture into your mustard arches to try one of your smoothies. \n\nAs soon as I walked in and looked around, I knew immediately that I didn't fit in. I won't get into specifics, but let's just say that many of your patrons have the \"I don't have a job and I don't care because I get unemployment checks\" look about them. Just sayin'. After I made my way through a throng of screaming kids running around barefoot, I finally made it to the counter. I decided to play it safe and order a strawberry banana smoothie thinking that you couldn't possibly mess that classic flavor up. I wasn't actually able to see you make this \"Real Fruit Smoothie\", as it was mysteriously whipped up behind the scenes in the back somewhere. I would say that next time I'll pay more attention, but unfortunately for you, there won't be a next time. \n\nAfter I made my way out of that hell hole and into the safety of my car, I took my first sip of your much hyped smoothie. I was instantly disappointed. By the time the liquid mush you call a smoothie hit the back of my throat, I knew that I had been duped. I took one more sip just to make sure that I hadn't missed something the first time, and threw the rest out. \n\nMcDonald's....come on. You don't make a \"Real Fruit Smoothie\" by blending up strawberry juice and banana flavored puree with some ice and yogurt and call it a smoothie. You're supposed to use REAL FRUIT! That drink was about as \"real\" as Joan Rivers face, or Pam Anderson's boobs...you might fool some dumbasses out there, but I think most people would rather pay a few bucks more and get the real deal down the street at Jamba Juice.  I mean, how hard is it to mess up a blended drink? Congratulations McDonald's, you never cease to amaze me...."}

{"text":"I wanted Sweet Republic, the plus one wanted something cheap after all of our baller status meals.... cheeseburger for him...... I got some more of that ice cream hehehe."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars simply because their drive thru is open 24 hours.  Can u imagine coming out of a casino or a movie and being hungry and not having a place to eat.  I've had the fish here and the burgers and fries and they have never screwed it up even when I asked for no tartar sauce.  Do you know how many times other places put it on anyway.\nThumbs up guys.  Thanks for being there!"}
{"text":"On my way to Ikea in Tempe yesterday and stopped by the D's for a quick drive through breakfast with the son and boy were they QUICK!  I think of the all the McDonald's I ever visited; this one just seems to stick out.  The person at the window was very nice, quick and made me feel like a valued customer by asking if I 1. Wanted the receipt instead of pushing it in my face! 2. Asked me if I needed any water with the breakfast burrito 3. Said thanks for coming.\n\nMade for a great start of the day with the son!\n\nGreat Job Guys - Well be back!"}
{"text":"This is one or the quickest McDonald's I have been to, during the lunch rush hour that's what I like. From the time I put my order in to receiving my food and drink was less than 3 minutes. They were ready and accurate on the order"}
{"text":"Yes, they are open 24 hours - but that is the ONLY plus. The staff does NOT pay attention to what you are ordering and the orders NEVER come out correctly. You are always constantly asked to pull forward to wait for your food --- AND if you are lucky they won't forget that they asked you to pull forward and actually bring your food out to you. By far the worst service ever and if it wasn't the closest one by about 5 miles, we would DEFINITELY go to a different McDonald's. Also, the \"managers\" do not care if you complain or whatever you have to say. It is so frustrating."}
{"text":"I come to this location once a week when I drive my mom to the doctor. The manager is always up in front greeting and serving people. I was finally able to get a triple cheese burger hot of the grill fresh and hot. Man I wish they all came to you like that"}
{"text":"McDonalds.  Hummm...\n\nGood food.  Quick in, quick out.  Clean restrooms.  It hasn't changed much since Ray Kroc made the template over 50 years ago.  \n\nYou may not like that McDonalds exists, but the food is well prepared and they execute on their stated goals.  \n\nSorry, if you wanted your burger animal style -- then go to In-n-Out!"}
{"text":"I don't eat McDonald's food, but for a quick coffee break this place is nice and clean, staff is friendly, and come on-- $1.46 for a coffee and a better-than-Tim-Hortons muffin?\n\nAlso they have a little TV mounted to the wall and when I came here during World Cup they had the game playing and let people congregate and watch, it's a somewhat West African neighborhood here and it was cool to see all the Ghanians gathered during the games.\n\nI was able to restrain myself from raging against McD's food in my review, so I'm giving myself 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"This is actually not a bad McDonald's. I've been coming to this location off and on for many years and the service, speed, and quality are fairly reasonable."}
{"text":"For a McDonald's in Etobicoke this location is pretty good! Drive thru is normally quite busy but also moves pretty quickly. Friendlier staff would make this a 5 star location"}
{"text":"This McDonald's is on my way home from work. I often have a craving for Chicken McNuggets. After work, I stop by to get my fix. \n\nThis place has only messed up my order once. I have been coming here for at least a couple of years. I was charged for the nuggets and drink, but I had indicated that I wanted \"combo number 8.\"  So, I got my fries for free. I think that my meal was cheaper with just the two items and don't recall getting a refund. \n\nAnyway, the parking lot has plenty of room. The drive-thru does get busy, but it moves! I tend to use my debit card to pay, which had never caused any issues. Staff are cheerful and polite. This place also has manager's specials now and again. \n\nI like this location better than the one closest to my home. \n\n(142)"}
{"text":"Absolutely worst McDonald's I've ever drove through. Came in at around 2am last night and ordered 3 hamburgers.. these people put so much salt and pepper on the burgers that they were not hardly edible. Yes.. it was that bad. It was almost as if they put a whole layer of salt and pepper on each side of the patties. And conveniently put VERY LITTLE sauce on all of them. These people that work this night shift need to be fired asap. We could even see the lady that was working laughing while talking to the cook. I guess even some people aren't professional enough to even work at a McDonald's.. sad."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst McDonalds ever they don't even deserve to be located in Summerlin with the type of customer service that they serve especially the management team the manager and ANAI is the worst she has the worst attitude and if her team messes up on your order she refuses to fix it she does not need to be part of the manager team she should be just a cashier with the type of attitude that she served these customers I will make sure everybody knows not to go to this McDonalds you might as well take the extra drive and go to the McDonalds that's on Charleston and Town Center they will give you better customer service and they don't have managers like her and this sucks because I can't post this without giving it one star but if it was up to me it will be no stars in till they get rid of that manager"}
{"text":"So I order a 20 piece McNuggets, wait 10 mins, get attitude from the drive thru window lady when she's giving me my food.  She can't even bother tobsay a word or answer me if that was everything.  I drive home and they didn't give me Sauce. \n\nSo you fail McDonalds.  BIG FAIL!"}
{"text":"This place sucks, slow, filthy and tons of homeless people inside.   Garbage everywhere.   All their soda machines are broke tonight too, what the heck.   I hate this place so much."}
{"text":"Seriously, this probably was the least friendly McDonald's ever.  Other than asking for our order, which was 3 coffees, they didn't say anything to us when we went to the drive-thru window or when we picked up the coffees.  Not one word.  We said thank you at each window.\n\nWill not go back to this McDonald's for anything."}
{"text":"This is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to by far. I cannot think of enough bad things to say about their service.\nThe Food is standard McDonald's fair, but, they did not give us our drinks with creamer, our order was wrong, the food oatmeal came without enough spoons for the orders count, we had to go back 3 times for all sorts of condiments, and they dish em out reservedly like their lives depend on it.\nThey do not seem to understand foreign accents and this is Las Vegas, seriously, if you are going to run a shop in a tourist town, you might as well be prepared for it."}
{"text":"This location sucks. It's always closed after 11 pm even though the drive thru says \"Open 24hrs.\" I know it's McD's and the food is terrible but not being open when you're trying to scratch an itch sucks."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me, but it seems like the staff at this location isn't all that friendly."}
{"text":"They didn't even deserve the 1 star I gave them. We went to this McDonalds and ordered some food. The food was good but I had some power tripping Mgr. Tell me and my son that we couldn't fill my Starbucks cup up with water....when I asked why she said because of cross contamination.....( now keep in mind this is a self service soda  machine) so that argument doesn't really fly since everybody using the machine is cross contaminating it.  This women poked my hand out of the way.....I'm like really women.....I left....and she says in a sarcastic tone....God bless you....I'm like he already has.... Get a life women!"}
{"text":"Thursday, 8:41AM:\n\nDecent speed for two breakfast meals. Friendly enough. Free WiFi, but who knows what info they're harvesting. Breakfast food has been consistent and good as far as fast food breakfasts.\n\nNo sugar or cream at condiments section...had to go back and ask. No coffee sitters. Napkin holders awry and messy. \n\nWorst thing was that the bottom of tray was covered in grease and it nearly slipped out of my hands...disgusting and unsanitary."}
{"text":"I stop here now and then as it's the closest to where I live.  Customer service used to be awful, but ti seems like they've gotten a bit better.  \n\nToday I got a side salad and a shamrock shake.  Everything was A-OK!"}
{"text":"My least favorite fast food place but my daughter's favorite so we make the appearance every now and then.  McDonalds has the best kids meals and playplaces so for my seven year old this is a great place.  Love the apple slices and much smaller fry bags for the kids.The sundays are good and the recently added smoothies are great.  Very disappointed in the new popcorn style chicken. It is worse than KFC's popcorn chicken was before they made larger pieces.  In fact, most of my box was just fried coating with little or no chicken.    As fast food places go, I find McDonalds the most consistent in quality and taste.  I love their breakfasts and the chicken nuggets are still the best.  Avoid the angus burgers.  They are not as good as advertized."}
{"text":"They advertise drive thru open 24 hours, but apparently close. I'm not sure the exact time but both times I went there was around 3am. There were no signs saying they were closed, so I sat there for a few minutes in the drive thru. Then I said hello? Twice then someone responded saying we will reopen at 4am. I was really ticked off because I wasted my time and gas. I will no longer go there."}
{"text":"Be careful!  I ordered an iced drink @ the drive thru.  The guy @ the second window never said hi or thanks.  I thought my drink was just wet on the outside.   Within minutes my  plastic cup was sticky.  By the time I got home my hands were sticky as well as my steering wheel, shifter, window controls.  It was a lot of work getting myself & the car cleaned.  \nI called the local office.  All she said was that she was sorry & she would tell them to wipe off the glasses.  She did not offer to have a manager call me &/or send me a gift card.\nI emailed corporate.  All I have received is a form email  back.  It's been 5 days.  I think I will stick w/iced-tea lemonades @ Coffee Beans & Tea Leaves.  Bye MacDonald's!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd closest McDs to my house. The closest one is so inconsistent that I come to this one more often. The drive thru can be long  and they often run out of cinnamon melts but the food is at least the way I ordered it and hot when I get it. The inside is clean and a mad house during breakfast time. All in all a decent location."}
{"text":"This location needs new supervision. I'd say about 8/10 orders I receive from this location is wrong or they just don't put the order together completely. Last 3 orders have been missing something. On one order, we ordered a fairly large order, about 8 different burgers. Of those, we asked for one Big Mac with no cheese. They didn't put cheese on ANY of them. In fact one we got ended up being a quarter pounder with just the bun, patty and pickles, nothing else. Nasty. \nThe other complaint I have is half the time, the attitude is far from friendly. I wouldn't say rude, just that couldn't be bothered kind of attitude, and that probably contributes to the messed up orders. \nSome people think that this kind of work deserves $15/hr. Those people are delusional. It's not the type of job that deserves that. Most people working at McD's are kids or students. Some management positions maybe, but not the average employee. Paramedics, paralegals, and other more important type of jobs don't pay that much. \nStill have problems. This is a complaint for July 21, 2016. Ordered a few things. One was a plain fish filet, then a couple Big Macs and a couple mcdoubles. \nFirst the filet. Specifically ordered a plain Filet o Fish, even saying to them 'all I want is the fish and the bun.' Got everything, tarter sauce, cheese etc. \nSo I asked them to fix it, again saying specifically how it should be- just the filet and the bun. Nothing else. So this time it had cheese on it. Really?!??!!! Luckily, the third time was the charm. \nNext the Big Mac. They forgot that middle piece of the bun when they were putting it together, so they just put it on top, then put the 'lid' piece on top of that. Wow. \nIt is clear that this location will never bother to fix their employee problem. I went back and read other reviews about this location, and it is staggering to me that after numerous complaints about the same reoccurring problems, they still haven't fixed the problems yet. I figured with a big company like this, all of these complaints would have made corporate management step in and make the necessary changes. A lot of corporate chains have stipulations where corporate HQ will fine the franchise owner, or if bad enough, force them out of the company. \nCORPORATE, if you are reading this, I would advise you to step in and fix this location. It is a complete and utter mess."}
{"text":"I can't really review this joint as they serve breakfast since 3am...I mean really? Can't get burger after 3am just breakfast? That's no even funny...majority of macdonalds are getting really bad and this is a prime example."}
{"text":"Really!!!  Hopefully this gets somewhere with you guys...this is the only way maybe you get your act together. (forget corporate number putting you guys on blast in front of everyone)  When a customer goes in and the place is not full in after hours (after 6:00 pm in last visit) or whenever you are not so busy.  If the customer says I'm not I hurry please last time I went through the drive thru..my burger was Simi Luke warm  and not to up to standard.  I get it...you get for what you pay for but if I had a choice between Jack in box and you guys I would probably choose jack in the box(I rather McDonald's)...I myself just got out of work and wanted something from you guys...I've had it before where it was all hot and fresh so it fucking infuriates me when I tell this to cashier...I specifically said I'm not in a rush...to start stale frys Simi Luke warm chicken nuggets and again Simi Luke warm quarter pounder with cheese...I'm not someone who eats burgers everyday but the day I do especially getting off from work I would like it hot and fresh....I wish In N Out was near thus location because I have seen what In N Out does to you guys on flaming and Fort apache...no comparison you would lose...\nAgain if someone tells you they are not in a rush...Please listen to them \nI've had it before in this location...let's see if someone in upper management sees this"}
{"text":"Kid wanted McDonald's and first off the fries are not fresh and the oil tastes old. The nuggets i ordered made fresh yet they still had an old taste to them. My kid loves sausage mcmuffins so I got two as well and they are burnt on the edges and sooo freaking hard to bite into.  Ridiculous. And we are dining inside while I watch these women in the back make food carelessly I have flies all over my food I don't even want to finish it so we will leave now. I really want to tell the manager how upset I am but he's a kid and I doubt a kid will satisfy my displeasing demeanor. I can say after my last debacle  here I will never return to this location I don't care if it's close to me. Id rather go to Boca park last time I was here I can't remember what my big issue was but the head manager called me apologized to me and sent me a few business type cards with a few free items I never came to get because I was so turned off by this location.  Just get better and care about the food you give people please. I worked at McDonald's when I was 15-17 and I know they have ethics and values just wondering why it's so lost in this location"}
{"text":"After yet another night of insane Vegas partying - and enjoying alcohol a-flowin' - we got the munchies. Where did we decide to go? When it's late and you want something cheap and easy (insert favorite jokes here), very little tops fast food.\n\nWe drove to a random McDonald's with a KFC next door - FYI, there are a LOT of them between the Strip and Red Rock (our hotel). At the drive-thru, we placed an order for large fries and 20 Chicken McNuggets.\n\nWhen we went to get our food, we were told they were out of large fries - how does that happen??? - and were given hash browns as a substitute. Since it was between three and four in the morning, we didn't press the issue.\n\nAnyway, the McNuggets were piping hot, fed us, and I have no idea what happened to those hash browns. What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, right?"}
{"text":"Seriously fed up with this location. every time i come here, theres conveniently something wrong with something. Or how about trying to order a simple mcdouble at 2am? ohh we only serve breakfast now at that time??? Since when??? Orders are always wrong, or its closed whens its a 24 hour location? i literally heard one of the cooks laugh when the lady said it was just breakfast. Do your freaking job. \ni will keep shining light on this terrible location until the matters resolved by mcdonalds. Ive wasted too much time and money here for your employees to screw up, or be lazy at my hard earned dollar."}
{"text":"Okay, I know it's McDonald's so it's not like I should expect a whole lot, but when I come here their food is either cold, their breakfast sandwiches are mushy (how do you mess up something that sits under a heat lamp?) and their chicken nuggets are always dry. Their customer service is really hit or miss, I've had some people at the drive thru be completely unprofessional and I've had others be very attentive. Like I said, I shouldn't expect much anyways because Duh, it's McDonald's but for some reason this McDonald's is bottom of the barrel."}
{"text":"So dirty! t's Tuesday afternoon. About 3 patrons inside and a random drive thru customer. About 4 staff behind the counter. Garbage cans are overfilling, tables have food stuck on them, and the fountain drink area filthy. I was afraid to touch anything. Lots of time to lean...no time to clean apparently. Food was alright and lazy staff was friendly tho."}
{"text":"If these folks could get an order right it would be a miracle, there has not been a time since this location opened that I did not have to return to get the order fixed."}
{"text":"Woke up after a night of mistakes.  With head in a Vitamax 7500, my buddy took me home, but not before a stop at McDonalds.  A taste of the familiar going years and years back.  It was like slapping a band aid on a sucking chest wound.  The breakfast did not cure, but offered temporary relief.  All in all.....an A-OK experience."}
{"text":"***GO TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION***\nWrong items. Cold fries. Burned nuggets. Forgotten straws. Missing items.  \n\nOver two years I've lived near this location. They have an accuracy rate of 40%. \n\nWe literally play McDonald's roulette at this location trying to guess what items they would forget. It's hilarious. Once ordered a southern style chicken sandwich and it came with a fish filet patty. You can't make this shit up lol. \n\nThis McDonald's location is exactly the reason a lot of America doesn't support an increase in minimum wage. You could throw random food at my car and it would be as accurate as these people trying to put together my order."}
{"text":"About as average as your local McDonald's can be.  This one is right up middle alley, not great but not spectacular either.  I just find it surprising the skinny-richie-constant work-outie people up here in Summerlin keep this place busy!  I mean literally not even a block away is Lifetime Fitness!  That place is hardcore.\n\nFood = OK.  Service = OK.  Fast and efficient as a colonoscopy.  Really nothing of greatness at this McDonald's.  Really run of the mill.  We often visit this location if we are staying in the nearby Red Rock Casino.  Although I would suppose this location stays steadily busy is in part because of the tourists that stay at the Red Rock as well and want cheap eats while on vacation.  Gotta make up for all those lost wages!\n\nNewest thing at McDonald's is their health-conscious Egg White 'Delight' McMuffin.  Definitely a healthier take on their breakfast menu.  And yes, I fell for that damn $1 coupon conveniently stuck to my McDonald's bag and tried one.  Myself being a bit of a health nut can't complain.  This egg white creation is pretty tasty.  Grilled egg whites, Canadian bacon (eh?), and white cheddar all on a toasted English muffin?  All for only 250 calories?  Yeah for a dollar I really liked it.  But at the regular price of almost $3?  I would have probably passed.  With coupon for $1 and a $1 coffee it made for a nice meal on the small scale of economy.  I almost, ALMOST, added a $1 hash brown.  Luckily I passed and decided to save my money & calories for later.\n\nOther than that, I think majority of people around the world know what McDonald's offers on their menu.  If you don't, dang, you must be living under a rock?  Or possibly a place where there is no McDonald's within your vicinity (like under a rock)."}

{"text":"This McDonalds needs help...\n\nI used to travel alot and Mcdonalds was always the \"go to\" fast food restaurant for us. Always consistant food and fast convenient service.\n\nThis branch is a very poorly run store. The last few times I have gone thru the drive thru the man taking the order was very rude. (the same person i think).. Could not seem to awnser any questions or be polite in any such way. And the food was sub par.\n\nTwo nights ago, we went to grab a quick snack wrap.. We were greated by a big man who had a very poor attitude. I thought maybe he was just having a bad night?? As we pulled to the counter to grab our order a car from the drive thru went around us to leave. He actually yelled at the man who takes orders that he needed to learn how to treat customers. I then knew that the rudeness that was suspected was not just my imagination.. \n\nTonight was the absolute last time I will ever go here.. We went thru the drive thru around 12:00 AM and for some reason the man who normally takes the order said that they would be closed for 15 minutes for a break??? This is supposed to be a 24 hour location. I wasn't sure if he said 15 or 50 minute break so I asked him when they would re-open to have him yell 15 back in the headset? Some seriously bad service. \n \nI will pass the word on that this location has inconsistant food and horrible service. The management at this fast food branch should be fired as well as the employees who seem to think that yelling at customers and treating them poorly is okay to do."}
{"text":"I only gave this place one star because there is no option for zero stars. First off.. Breakfast all day at McDonalds.. Awesome right? Well don't try to order the big breakfast platter from this place after noon.. Cause they will tell you they don't make it. I can't understand why.. If they serve breakfast all day now.. Why a menu item that has \"breakfast\" in the title is not served? And then be rude to the customer for asking them to explain why they don't make it. How hard is it to scramble some eggs on the grill.. And put a sausage patty on a plate.. The same sausage patties that they use on the sandwiches.. And put a biscuit on the plate.. Same biscuit used for the sandwiches.. I mean what's the extra step..? The eggs that take 30 seconds to scramble.. ? I just don't understand.. Then another employee gives me attitude for asking for ketchup.. It's like.. You work at McDonald's and act like its hard to put the correct food in the bag.. And that it's difficult to give a customer ketchup when you ask for it.. I mean I worked at McDonald's when I was younger and it was mandatory that we asked customers if they would like ketchup.. But maybe the standards of service have been lowered due to the incompetent employees they always seem to hire.."}
{"text":"I've been to this drive through 3 times. I order simple things like a Big Mac meal or a couple burgers and fries. Yet some how they have never gotten my order correct. Today I ordered two hamburgers and fries. My hamburgers were damp and had pickled jalape√±os instead of regular pickles. Not sure if this was a bad prank by the young staff or just a shitty burger that was made by someone who doesn't know the difference.\n\n\nAlso their drive through is always packed and people line up into the adjacent albertsons parking lot and road. Come on fatties.... At that point park and walk in."}
{"text":"I've been through in on a number of occasions and have never had a problem.\n\nFood is typical Mcdonalds and it's always hot so nothing to complain about here. The drive through is usually fast. \n\nAs for whether or not the staff is friendly, I usually go here early in the morning, so I really don't care. I'm not friendly myself in the morning LOL     So as long as my order arrives promptly and they don't talk much and my coffee is hot  I'm good with it."}
{"text":"Why is it that I always get the late-night staff that could care less about making their food good? The fries were old and hard, the burger was cold, and the soda was flat. One of the kids was leaning against the counter texting, another was sitting on the counter talking, and another had his iPhone headsets on when bringing the food. Cmon kids, please try to have a better work ethic so you'll have a better future in life."}
{"text":"This place really is hit or miss on the service.\n\nThe food: cheap, that's why you go here. Period.\n\nThe service: Like I said, on & off. Sometimes they mess up. They're busy.. Cause of that heaven sent dollar menu. Love hate relationship guys.\n\nUpdates: They've got smoothies, & I love me some Mango Pineapple. Yum! :D\n\nI would rate only 3 stars, but it keeps the 4th cause it's down the street. \nI know, stupid reason. Well, shut it & write your own review... please. LOL."}
{"text":"Yes...it has come to this.  I only feel compelled to write this review because I work nearby, and I visit this McDonalds at least once a week.  I admit, I am a Dollar Menu addict. Where else can you get reasonably full for less than $5 for lunch. Nevermind the guilt and dangerous chemicals.\n\nAnyway, the set up of the drive through makes for a real pain during peak lunchtime hours. This McDonalds is situated in a busy shopping center, right next to a Starbucks, Del Taco, Albertsons, Bank of America, and other shops. Things get rather congested and hard to maneuver.  However, as McDonalds goes, it is fine. The service is usually friendly and prompt (although the new guy they have in the drive thru is a *tad* too chatty!), and they haven't messed up my order.  Freshness and hotness varies, however."}
{"text":"I must say that I had a smoothie here when they came out months ago and they are horrible and way too sweet. Sonic has better ones and McD's obviously doesn't use real fruit. Even at midnight, this is not the best sweet tooth option. Wait, there is a positive. Using my 2-1 coupon, I tried the new Strawberry Frozen Lemonade and yes like the commercials indicate it is tart and sweet. These would be a better option to cool you down at $1.59 for a small. The strawberry syrup at the bottom might be the same they use on sundaes, but who knows for sure. McDonald's comes out with new stuff every month, but in the beverage department, frozen lemonade is king."}
{"text":"I would have given this 5 stars if not for the fact that the chucklefuck drive thru staff randomly leaves work at 10 when it closes at 11 and when they are working do some fucked up things.\n\nExample: I had lost my job, my wife, and my car, and a friend of mine picked me up on the side of the road, but not before I was forced to suck a dick for the $2 that would give me the moolah to afford a single pleasure in this meaningless world: a medium fry from THE KING of fast food, Ronald \"Firecrotch\" McDonald. We drove to this establishment, as it was nearest to the drug den that I had just left. Purple haze ringing in my nostrils and Nickelback blaring from the Hummer H2 behind me, I ordered my delicacy. Upon arriving at the window, I was shocked to find that the Americans with Disabilities Act applies to people who were born sideways with three umbilical cords wrapped around their extra chromosome. Good job being progressive giants, McDonalds. UNFORTUNATELY, this coke bottle glasses-wearing invalid decided to give me, a man with nary a possession to his name, a medium fry trapped indecently in a complex puzzle box constructed from bags that had clearly formerly hosted the cursed sperm sample that grew his hairy greasy ass in a test tube in Santa Monica. I was speechless, but since I couldn't afford a drink, a fire in the hole was not possible and I had to suffice with a middle finger held aloft by my comrade in my defense against this venerable Smaug of the culinary industry. Never again. 9/11 is in my heart today and tomorrow and the next day but after that idk seriously."}
{"text":"The employees and manager, Andreas, don't listen very well!!  I've had to visit this location to many times and each time my order was wrong!  I won't be visiting this location again!  Also, the  espresso machine seems to be consistently \"down\" and long lines are a few more concerns. The owner should have contact info posted publicly, as they should be made aware that the employees and manager aren't processing orders correctly, inefficient and the long drive thru lines maybe the end result!"}
{"text":"Micky D's should all be the same, but this one in the 10 plus year I've been going there has about the most stand offish unfriendly people ever. It starts from the top so I guess the owners just don't care if there employees are unfriendly."}
{"text":"The service here is pretty good. The manager Ronald is a really nice person. His personality is always happy and is nice every time we come. Food is always fast and quick!"}
{"text":"Good service but drive thru is slow!  When I pick up breakfast for the office- this is usu the place- but just to warn every1, I think going in is faster- but if you have a big order, you may get the stink eye from the other customers- just pretend to read the newspaper- or cont yelping to avoid eye contact!"}
{"text":"I went to this location a couple of weeks ago. This is how my visit went:\n\nI pulled in the drive thru a few minutes before 10:30am just in time for breakfast. \nI was the only person in the drive thru so I pulled right up to the menu\nI waited for someone to take my order at the speaker but no one said anything\nFinally an employee with an headset walked out of the back room of Mcdonalds\nI figured this was because the order speaker was broken or something\nBut no, the employee walked over and flipped the menu from breakfast to lunchtime\nI was thinking in my head .... whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?\nKeep in mind, my car is right there, I'm obviously waiting to order.\nThen the employee turned around and walked back into McDonalds\nThen someone started taking my order over the speaker\nI ordered my breakfast items. which they informed me they were no longer serving. \nI was thinking in my mind \"do you not think I just saw you walk out and turn the menu, I mean my car was like 2 feet away from you\"\nAnyway, I was craving breakfast, so I let them know I wanted to cancel my order\nI was told the breakfast hours were over\nThen ... magically ... like a Christmas Miracle, they had breakfast for me.\n\nTruth is I was willing to leave McDonalds with out my breakfast food. I have a rule for myself. I never fight with people that make my food behind closed doors. Yea, maybe paranoid but sadly its a reality. So I was completely polite about canceling my order. I do believe they did the right thing by offering me these breakfast items. Where i find the problem is the simple lack of customer service. That conversation of them no longer serving breakfast was one we should have never had. Implying that my order was an inconvenience when clearly It shouldn't have been. \n\nSo then, i went back a few days later (because I'm the type that gives second chances) and they missed a few items that I had ordered. Meaning I ordered them, saw it on the drive thru order menu screen, paid for it and it wasn't in my bag when they gave me my order.\n\nYea, this is a long review, I would honestly be surprised if someone read down this far. Props to you if you have. But the whole reason behind it is that I am just super tired of getting terrible customer service and paying for food that I don't get. The reason this review is only 1 star is because I have given this place multiple visits and keep coming up with the same problem. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"Long waits.  You'll get your food faster at many other non-'fast food' restaurants.  The 'drive-thru' line quickly fills up and begins to block the flow of traffic in the parking lot.  It's not uncommon to be not given requested sauces (e.g. hot sause for sausage burritos, ketchup for fries).  \n\nSame barely edible quality food that you might expect to find.  Customer service is worse than the sub-par service you might expect."}
{"text":"If you are thinking \"WTF?\", don't worry, I am too. Yes, I am writing a review of McDonald's. As a child, I was a fiend for their french fries. If we were within 100-yards of the spot, I could smell those suckers and break into tears with FF desire. \n\nFast-forward to today, and I can't remember the last time I ate food from McDonald's. (Ice cream cones don't count, and neither do desperate breakfasts on the road with a band.) However, two things:\n\n1. This location has a 24-hour drive thru.\n2. They now have smoothies! When it's midnight and you want a smoothie, what do you do? Consider ordering a Wild Berry or Mango-Pineapple from Mickey D's. They are cold, refreshing and tangy. All in all a decent smoothie. \n\nI don't think it will kill you. (It hasn't killed me yet, but I've only had a total of 3 smoothies.)"}
{"text":"I like this particular McDonalds. Service is generally fast and courteous and I've never had a problem the many times I've been here. I usually order the number 2 meal and it's always prepared the way it's supposed to be."}
{"text":"Other than the fact there is a Redbox outside and a two lane drive thru (at least at the star) there isn't anything great about this MCD's. If you are up for some nuggets or a Big Mac why not? But if not probably best to go to any of the other fast food joints nearby. Trust me it's not like there isn't one in throwing distance."}
{"text":"I felt like chicken mcnuggets one day after shopping.  So on the way home, I decide to through the drive thur to get my lunch and something for the hubby too.\n\n10 McNuggets - OMG, they were HARD not crispy\nQuarter Pound with cheese - Ok, the buns were a little hard\nMcDouble with cheese - Hubby, same taste and the bun was soft\nFries are GOOD!\n\nDo not know if it is this location or an off day for McD's."}
{"text":"My mom came here a few times to use the wifi and since I tagged along I decided to order while I waited. So today she ordered a large drink, fry, two apple pies and a sundae. So at ten minutes we both realized we were actually still waiting! I walked up to the counter and just stood there. One guy walked up to the register and walked away. Another young lady walks up and just stands there as if she's waiting for one of the patrons to ask how can we help her. \n\nSo I finally ask what's up with the order. I tell them it's beyond ridiculous that we are still waiting when there are only 4 other individuals in this dang place. So one person asked another where the order was and that person asks that person how many pies and it just pisses me off. Dude, this is not brain surgery. So they apologize about the wait and then start the order. The order took about 20 mins. The best part of all is the sign in the cooking area that states they need to be faster. No Sh!t Sherlock."}
{"text":"Went to McDonald's for a snack. Decided to try the new mozzarella sticks (2 sets of 3 for $2) and shared a large order of fries. The fries were good. The cheese sticks were OK... they really needed to be hotter. I've had far better."}
{"text":"Went in here for lunch on a Friday afternoon, ordered my food, sat down and started sweating because it was so hot. By the time my food was done myself and another customer were at the front counter to ask about why it was so hot. The other customer was a grandmother there with her grandson and both were drenched in sweat. The employee told us that the corporate office sets the thermostat and there was nothing she could do. I asked to speak to a manager and was told there was not one on duty. I asked if she could call someone about the situation and she said no, it wont do any good anyway, they will not adjust the thermostat. I canceled my order and went to the McDonald's in Buckeye, which was nice and cool. This is Arizona guys, turn that AC up!!"}
{"text":"literally spent 20 minutes in the drive thru...there were only 3 cars in front of me and I only ever saw one bag of food go...the others were drinks so annoying"}
{"text":"I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich meal from Dysart and I-10 location and when I got my order, I had to request new fries. I leave drive thru and opened my chicken sandwich and it looks extra hard, but I bite into it anyway only to taste a very hard sandwich. I could not turn around to request a new meal at the time, but on my way back passing McDonald's, I called and told the person I wanted a refund. When I brought my food back, the manager Jocelyn said I would only be getting a refund for the sandwich since I ate the fries and asked me if that was ok? I said no, but whatever. I will be contacting the Goodyear corporate office 7/25/16 to inform them of my experience with their restaurant! I even gave the sweet tea back because it was not good either. Their quality at that location always seem to be bad. I will just not eat there anymore!"}
{"text":"Had very few problems here over the years I've been going, Tanya at the first drive through window has always been cheery and it helps put me in a good mood for the morning.  This morning they had a guy spraying off the drive through at the busiest time so I'm not sure if the manager was confused but it definitely want the best time for that.  Food is usually fresh and service usually snappy."}
{"text":"This McDonalds is the worst! Remember to hold up the drive thru line and make sure you have every single thing you paid for.  I'm pretty sure they are only able to make a profit by short changing their drive thru customers."}
{"text":"The casher handled money and made my order without washing her hands, Yuck!!"}
{"text":"I usually never ever go to any McDonald's the food always is the same and is never fresh or is stale. So my friends wanted to go here to try the new buttermilk chicken sandwich I figure why not. So we order 2 combo. When we got it. The buns look like they been burned almost like bulk bread. Chicken sand which was dry and distasteful. Also to top things off the French fries taste like they say in the oil for hours. I called the manager and explain to her. She apologize and said yeah we been getting a lot of complain about the oil in the fries tonight. WHY on earth would you still serve them to me or anyone else if you know they don't taste right. Should of have went with my guy and stayed away. Nothing ever changes about these places no matter what location you go to. Let's be honest if there complaint about not making enough. And want a raise. Most likely they are doing a half ass job to start with hence why food always taste awful or stale."}
{"text":"Worst mcdonalds ever in the history of mcdonalds.  Food sucks, place is disgusting and dirty, soda is always watered down.  Staff is beyond rude. Including the management.  I work close by so I have no choice but to eat there. They mess up my order every time.  Wish I could give negative stars."}
{"text":"Ice cream comes out of the machine like paste. Please get it fixed. \n\nThanks"}
{"text":"I give them a 3 because the girl was new ill cut her some slack she took 20 minutes to take my order and no one helped or checked on Rochelle. She reads my order to me everything is ok good comes and it is wrong. After that they took 30 minutes to fix my order and check my receipt. I then wait another 20 and not done jajaja. 3 people before me waiting for there order one comes to see what's going on they take the order against. It's McDonald's can't say much but yeah don't ask for a 15 dollar the HR guys . Update she got my order wrong again thus the 1 star"}
{"text":"Would be better if they got my order right! Every time I've been there it's messed up. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I avoid this mcdonalds at all costs. The food is always cold, orders take a long time and are usually wrong, and the workers aren't very friendly. Theres another mcd's on pearl rd and in neighboring cities that are much better than this one. its a shame."}
{"text":"Restaurant is fairly clean.  Tables usually need to be wiped down yourself before you are able to sit.  Staff is not very inviting or friendly.. Cashiers rarely greet you before you order, they usually just stare at you and wait for you to order."}
{"text":"Reviewing fast food is petty and I rarely bother but in this instance, it should be noted Rex the MANAGER is highly unprofessional.\n\nA young girl walked up to the registers and simply asked for her cup to accompany her kids meal. He looked at her without missing a beat and snapped back \"You'll get your drink with your meal!\" and stormed off as if the girl ruined his day by asking such a \"rude\" question. \n\nTalking to an adult like that is one thing but to openly yell at a child like that is just plain stupid."}
{"text":"About the same as everywhere else.  Does have 24 hour service.  Right by freeway and two lanes for service."}
{"text":"As far as McDonalds go, this is a fantastic location.  The location is modern, updated and clean.  The staff was super friendly, which says a lot, given they were working on Christmas Eve."}
{"text":"The kid won't eat at Del Taco, so it's a two-stop lunch.  Fine.  \n\nOrdered easily in the drive-thru, tended prompted to my a young woman with dual eyebrows (unusual, but not bad: the original set, and a second pair penciled about an inch higher; interesting look), and out the door again.\n\nThe girl toy in the kid's meal was a decorate-yourself little generic Hot Wheels car, but she's a tomboy and loves stickers, so no harm, no foul."}
{"text":"BRADLEY O'HALLORAN offered:\n* Exceptional courtesy\n* Cheerful professionalism\n* Grace under morning rush\n* Good communications skills\n* Quick, efficient handling of food items\n\nAnd did I mention it was THANKSGIVING?\n\nKudos to a young man who adds a lot of class to his neighborhood McDonalds location!"}
{"text":"Dont go to this Mcdonalds! 1st we ordered 2 value meals and 2 happy meals. We go to get our drinks and the sprite and dr pepper are both out. My gf only drinks sprite. So we go back to the counter and tell them that the sprite and dr pepper are both out. The guy tells us that he forgot to tell us hen we ordered that they were out of supply of bothe sprite and dr pepper which would have changed our mind about getting a value meal in the first place! The drink station had no lids for our drinks and was filthy. So then we get our food. The fries were fresh and hot and the sandwich seemed kinda old so basicly it was a cold n spicy instead of a hot n spicy. I start eating my fries and they have no salt on them. I take them back up to the counter and tell them these fries have no salt and that I  would like fresh fries with salt. They make me some fries and give them to me again with no salt. I tell them i wanted salt on my fries. They hand me some salt packets. I tell them no I want the salt on them as soon as they come out of the oil or the salt wont stick. With attitude and back talk they procede to remake my fries again then forget tat im there waiting for my fries. Finally someone asks me what I need. Their reason for the fries not having salt on them is that they dont have the proper tool that puts the salt on the fries so lets just serve the fries with no salt. Im pretty sure its possible to salt fries without a \"special tool\". But the fact that i got attitude for simply wanting what I paid for ensures that I will not go back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"I've been rather disappointed in the McD's I've been stopping in lately, and I remember this being a total dive years ago. Came in for sodas-the staff is nice, the place is clean; then my cousin and I were very impressed at how well the team was communicating with each other."}
{"text":"on My Way home from work I and My Husband stopped off to get something to eat, as we Love Mc Donalds its always Our first choice, so we pulled in to the drive thru and put in Our order 2 #3 meals ( Quarter Pounders) we always as for no Ketchup, first the window opened and we was given 2 wet Straws for Our drinks ( disgusting! then the burger meals came we drove home to find the burgers looked like they had been reheated, there was no mustard, no pickles and was almost cold, the fries could have done with a bit longer as well, there was no receipt either and so after spending almost $14 it has left a nasty taste in Our mouths, we Love Mc Donalds and yet this was disgusting! we always choose Mc Donalds as our go to when we want a burger and I am sure we will continue but this one was disgusting, as a Golden Reviewer on Trip Adviser I will make sure this Mc Donalds get the review its deserves Disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"it's in not the best  condition, staff is small which creates long lines and also the food is not  so good, I had the impression that they change the  oil very rare . But  the ice cream is the same, is good!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst McD's I've been to in Vegas.  It's super slow and dirty.  If it wasn't close to my work, I wouldn't go here...in fact, if I do go to McDs, I will just opt to go one closer to home just to avoid this place. \n\nAlso, the drive thru is horribly organized.  You're likely to get into a car accident if you try and use it."}
{"text":"By far, this is one of the worst mcd's that I've been to.  The establishment reeks, the floor creaks, and there is a strong draft that smells like sweat stank.  I ordered a big mack, and a mighty kids meal cheeseburger for my nephew: No. 14 Duck Fan.  The food took at least 15 minutes, and when it got here, it was a soggy piece of crap... Both of 'em!!!  And... The toy that came with my little nephew's kids meal- the piece of crap China plastic angry birds toy- it was broken!  I had to distract the people at the counter so he could sneak in and steal all the toys.  Then, I proceeded to throw the broken toy at the window, breaking it, and then ran out, jumping into mah Honda Civic.. 2009.. And dashed away down the road."}
{"text":"Love me some McDonald's on the way home from Las Vegas. Made it over there this morning just in the time for breakfast. Was very disappointed why I reached in for my sausage mcmuffin with egg and someone had already taken a bite. Gross! Pick a different location for your post partying feast (unless you like partially eaten breakfast sandwiches)."}
{"text":"Yesterday I was starving so I stopped by here for a Southwest salad. To my surprise, this salad was full of fresh romaine lettuce and warm moist strips of pretty tasty chicken. This salad has only 450 calories which is a huge plus. They have two other types of salad for even less calories, but I bet they aren't as tasty as this one. I highly recommend going to McDonald for a last minute salad instead of the Taco Bell's Cantina bowl."}
{"text":"Avoid this location. I recently went here and placed a big order. They managed to forget my 20 piece nugget, not the end of the world right? Called them when I noticed and they told me to come back in. When I arrived the cashiers swore up and down that they gave me my nuggets and basically called me a liar in the dining room.\n\nNever thought that I would be publicly embarrassed over $5 of nuggets by $9 employees.\n\nCorporate eventually sent me a voucher to use that this specific location. Hoping they don't claim it's fake."}
{"text":"Put the Oreos on top of the McFlurey and forgot to mix it. I had to mix it myself. First world problems people."}
{"text":"Fries sucked at this location, I mean shit thats the only good thing at MCdonalds what the crap man!"}
{"text":"We stopped by last night to check out the McRib so this review is for that. I can honestly say that the McRib is McGross. The sauce cloyingly sweet, the meat had the texture of a sponge and after a couple bites I threw it out. Im not quite sure that the big deal is about with this sandwich. I do remember having one as a kid but like Twinkies somethings just taste better when you're young. \n\nThe staff here was really friendly and while the sandwich was gross, it was served hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this location of the McDonalds. There are a few problems I have with it though. I have asked for water (this was twice within a fifteen minute period) and never received it. When I ordered three chocolate sundaes, they had no problem getting them to me! Just don't ask for something like water. There are also a lot of bums that hang out in there and it can become unsafe for kids. For the most part, John (the main manager) will drive them out of there after awhile. There are also a lot of teenagers which can become somewhat unruly. It is not in the greatest area, but it is actually a good location. The quality of the food seems great though..."}
{"text":"Some \"Latisha\", you know the type; fat, ghetto, long ass cheaply painted Ho' nails, skimmed my debit card. Her and her homeboys shopped at Wal-Mart in North Las Vegas (of course) and a liquor store. (Also, of course). My bank's fraud dept and the police are involved, Letisha (or a similar ghetto-named pos) isn't very smart. Easy to figure out who did it, and exactly when, thanks to the receipt.  And you want $15 an hour for crappy service and thievery? Biotch, please! Gonna enjoy testifying against you, Ho'."}
{"text":"What has happened to McDonalds.  The service with a smile is definite out the window.  Here, we passed by drive-thru and ordered 2 number one meals (2 egg mcmuffin  meals) with ice coffees.   The lady who is entering the order entered 2 egg mcmuffins, 2 hash browns and 2 coffees and charged about $14.46.  I explained over the intercom that I ordered the meals and she began to argue that it was the meals. I again explained that she entered the items individually which results in a higher price than if entered as a meal.  She said it's the same as the meal and then told me to \"just drive to the first window!\"  At the window a nice guy said, \"you ordered the 2 mcmuffins, 2 hash browns, and 2 ice coffees.\"   I explained I ordered the meals.  He corrected it and charged $13.37.   Now $1 is not much but if they are doing this to everyone it adds up.  Then I realized that the food is not that great or healthy, the service is terrible (having seen a smile at a drive thru in a year and need to argue for $1) and I have no need for happy meals or to entertain kids, so what is the point of going there?  It seems like I have accepted it.  Well it's time to stop.   Good bye McD.   Hello pollo loco."}
{"text":"8:55 AM\nGranted they're breakfast tastes decent. However, you had one fucking job. Put 4 mcgriddles in the bag and hand me my coffee! The coffee clearly has been sitting out because I got iced and it was warm as fuck. Then i get home, and they're biscuits not mcgriddles. The guy messes up the orders in front of me as well. You work at fucking McDonald it's not that hard. Warm the shit up and put it in the bag. No thanks, I'll start going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I only stop here if I need something quick (a drink or one ice cream cone) because there's always a disastrous combination of screaming children and stressed out employees at this location. Today was no different but at least I got my order quickly and got out. Be careful--there are always sketchy people or leering guys outside."}
{"text":"Terrible experience! First of all, I had to wait at the window for 5 minutes (no joke!!) without being acknowledged. Second, when I finally do get my food and drive away, the kid that was supposed to be put on my cup flew off as I turned, causing my Dr. Pepper to spill all over the inside of my car. When I finally have a second to eat my food, everything's stone cold! Like the pancakes tasted like they were leftover from yesterday, the hash browns were equally cold, and the sausage biscuit was also cold. I cannot stress enough how poor of service there is at this location. You'd be better off running the place by yourself. Poor management and poor employees make this place a must avoid."}
{"text":"I've ordered 3 Mocha as it says on the menu. An employee taking my order punched it as Mocha Frappe or something and I got Iced Mocha. I explained that I wanted hot Mocha and I didn't order Iced Mocha. Employees said then I was supposed to say \"Hot Mocha\" instead of just Mocha. Then why they put just \"Mocha\" on the menu?? Why do they have Iced Mocha on the menu? Why don't they state on the menu that I have to order Hot Mocha? I would do that. Isn't it supposed to distinguish between hot and iced Mocha? Why the employee didn't ask me to make sure if it's hot or cold? Why did they blame me by saying exactly what appears on the menu? Just MOCHA! \nAnd whoever manager there, how come they have only one employee taking orders? People in line also got pissed because of waiting time.\nNow it takes forever to re-make my order. I'm so pissed. I will not come back here again."}
{"text":"It's a 24 hour location but say \"their systems are down\" almost every time I pull in between 2-4am ish. Thanks a lot!"}
{"text":"First impressions: the first time I checked in here, the drive thru is extremely slow. Shows that it's very unorganized inside. \n\n2nd time here, I decided to go inside to order to-go and it's just my luck that the soda machine was down so they only offered sweet tea and iced coffee. The lady who was placing my order spoke in a very low tone that I could barely hear her and I had to repeat myself many times. Waiting for my order, I chose to sit down at a table. I was searching for a clean table and chair to sit in and managed to find one. \n\nThat's twice now that I've had a bad experience with this mcdonalds. I'll definitely be going to a different mcdonalds even though this one is the closest one to where I live."}
{"text":"On occasion, I take my son to get a happy meal here. He doesn't like fries, so we either get double apple slices, or a yogurt/apple slices. This has never been a problem, until today. The manager has decided that this has to be up charged now. I don't have a problem with an extra dollar and some change. What I have a problem with is how McDonald's is discouraging healthful eating now. For many, that dollar up charge could be a big deal for families on a budget, and could discourage them from having their kids eat more heathy items. Chicken nuggets and burgers have enough fat and sodium, so why force fries down everyone's throat?  90% of people will order it \"as is\". They should not discourage the other 10%.\n\nI personally will not set foot in this establishment again, or go through it's drive-through.  I don't know if this is a corporate policy, or the franchises decision. Either way, they need to change this rediculous policy.\n\nTo top it off, they got my order wrong. Luckily I always double check my order before I leave, since this place gets it wrong 50% of the time.\n\nGet it together McDonald's."}

Although I said \"For here\", she still put my order in a to-go bag. No biggie really. The drink, condiment, napkin station was clean & dry but one of the two napkin dispensers was empty.(since there are 2 dispensers & one was filled, again no biggie) I have to say at this moment in time, this McDonalds was FAST. My order was handed to me b4 I could walk away & fill my drink. (2 breakfast burritos) The man behind me ordered one of the breakfast combo's with a large drink & his order was done quickly as well. I have to say I'm mostly impressed with the cleaning. After the lady finished mopping the dining room, she went outside & cleaned off the 3 tables on the patio. Oh, right, the food. My two breakfast burrito's were hot, tasted fine and were filled with an average amount of the egg, cheese, sausage & bell pepper filling. Because there was nothing to mark off on, I would give 3 stars. But since the place was just so dang clean, I' m going to upgrade my score to a 4 star."}

Lately I like coming here for breakfast and get pancakes with  iced coffee which I enjoy. They have dollar parfait's that are good. This location has two drive threw that get backed up sometimes. I'm sure most of you have had McDonalds and this location has all the same meals and burgers. The food is always good and seems to be fresh here and the workers are friendly also."}
{"text":"I am so angry. It's 9:30 at night and I haven't eaten all day. I thought I'd drive through and get something quick. I ordered a #2 Extra Value meal. For decades, and I mean that literally as I am 50, a #2 value meal has been a quarter pounder with cheese. I had to wait in the parking lot for 10 minutes after I was told it would be 3 so she could wait on every other car that drove through behind me. When she finally came out I drove home only to see that I got 2 cheeseburgers. I called them and they said that 2 days ago they changed the menu and a #2 is now 2 cheeseburgers. \n\nYou'd think that after 20 or 30 years of a #2 being something else they would have at least mentioned it.\n\nAnd to top it all off the puny little nothing of cheeseburgers are cold. Apparently they were in the bag the whole 10 minutes while I was waiting.\n\nI'll never go back."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd see the day where I was reviewing a fast food chain.  But this place has a great breakfast with great service.\n\nI just recently found out that the Egg McMuffin can be ordered as an Egg WHITE McMuffin.  And the hot cakes...for fast food quality, 4 stars!\n\nAnd you can't beat the price.  I ordered and Egg white McMuffin, 3 hash browns, 1 biscuit, and 1 coffee for 11 bucks!\nEnjoy"}
{"text":"Close by my house and convenient.\n\nMcDonalds are good for four things:\n\n1. Quick, free Wi-Fi - yes that's right! MCDs have WiFi. When I told my friend that, she looked at my in surprise. I don't have a smart phone or any fancy devices besides an iPod touch which I use religiously to look up things (but requires WiFi).\n\n2. Thirsty? $1 drinks! You can't beat that. If you drink too much of the soda (non-diet), it might do you more harm than good especially with all the calories, sugar and phosphorous so keep everything to a minimum but it's a good deal. Why would anyone want to purchase a smaller size if it's all $1?\n\n3. CHICKEN NUGGETS! MCD chicken nuggets are good. 20 pieces for $4.99! Get them while they last! Go for the ranch, honey mustard or sweet and sour sauce. (I hate it when they charge you more for extra sauce so make the most out of the free ones you get)\n\n4. Fries! MCD fries are pretty darn good - I wish they were cheaper but hey, I can't complain. I am trying to be more health conscious (I guess eating at MCD doesn't help) but if you do decide to eat here, try getting them without salt. Fries come out fresh and piping hot! You can add salt and pepper to your liking. I just add black pepper, I love black pepper.\n\nWoopeedoooo. \n\nThis MCD has everything."}
{"text":"Dumpy as they go. I've never consistently waited so long in a drive thru as I do here. It's dreadful.  I don't know who the manager is but he needs to attend Hamberger University!"}
{"text":"The worst looking McDonald's in the whole West-island of Montreal! \nThe funkiest too! Who owns this dump?\nStay clear of this place or use it for the kids playground which is ginormous but apparently only for the taller kids.\nThis place is in desperate need of a make over! \nThey have the coffees but no \"create your own taste\" burgers or \"jails\" (gels?) women/girls that walk around and refill your coffee and bring you your special burgers...\nThis McDonald's is like stuck in the early 90s. Just like the one in Kirkland, but at least that one has a Walmart attached to it!\nThe food is the regular fast-food stuff.\nThey should rent it out to a film crew filming a movie set in the 90's.\nThe drive through's food goes on a conveyor belt over the people seated! OMG!\nThat's awesome!\nThere are live plants in the restaurant!\nWow, what a trip! \nA bad trip."}
{"text":"Had mixed experiences with this location.  Most of the times service was decently fast but on a couple occasions a was stuck at the drive thru for more than 10 minutes,  which is unacceptable at McDonald's when there're 3 cars in front of you. They make mistakes in my orders more than they should (is extra mustard in my quarter pounder that hard to understand?). But hey,  having worked in multiple fast food chains I understand that it's more a question of bad management than anything else.  Other than that,  it's McDonald's as usual."}
{"text":"This place used to be really dirty -- I mean the dirtiest of all McDonald's I've ever been to -- especially the play area. They have improved a lot and is now very clean. Perhaps they've listened to my complaints. I'm impressed. I hope they continue to maintain the cleanliness so I can finally be comfortable celebrating my kids' birthdays here."}
{"text":"No problems with my apple pies (lukewarm) and sundae, and my daughter had a great time in the larger-than-average play place. She's not 3 yet, and had trouble getting up levels in the structure on her own. Probably most suitable for ages 4+."}
{"text":"Very very slow. They have told me that hey can't make separate orders in the drive thru and the drive thru is incredibly slow. I understand it's a busy McDonald's, but they are awful at customer service. Go to any other McDonald's if you can because this one is horrible."}
{"text":"This is what you call a milkshake... What a rip off. Nothing like the picture or what I've got in the past. And the drive thru worker didn't apologize or offer to remake it. Won't be back."}
{"text":"UGH! The absolute worst!!! I can't believe this place is able to stay in business & bear the Golden Arches! How dare they!\nOnly thing reminiscent of a Mickey D's is at least the sweet tea is on point & that's it -\nThey are the slowest rudest saltiest & grossest mc D's around - do yourself a favor & keep truck in til u see the next set if Golden Arches - this place is a dump!"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING!!  What a nasty McDonalds! The bathrooms were filthy with no toilet paper. Waited a ridiculously long time for a Jalapeno Double burger which was so gross I threw the majority of it in the trash. It was cold and the slice of processed cheese they slopped on there was not even close to melted. Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!"}
{"text":"I realize that a place that has a majority of their menu priced under $2.00 is not going to blow me away... BUT, the wait times are HORRIBLE!!! Whether you go in or the drive thru it's bad either way. I'm in Boca Park quite often, so I'll run in from time to time & it's NEVER good! The employees are rude & it's always 15-20 min wait times! The only reason it gets an xtra star is I can get a side salad with low-cal dressing for $1.00. I've never been to a McDonalds that was this consistently bad..."}
{"text":"Went to this McDonalds on February 26, 2016 at 3:34 p.m. As I walked in, everything was remodeled and renovated into the modern style restaurant. The staff here was friendly and the place seems clean.\n\nAs for the food, I ordered 20 pieces of chicken nuggets and two large drinks for me and my brother. The chicken nuggets taste the same as always. For the drinks, I tried the Sweet Tea, it tasted ok. The Sweet Teas at the other McDonalds is usually very sweet. Instead, this McDonalds put less sugar. The best part of this McDonalds is that they have a custom Coca Cola Freestyle machine where you can customize your drinks."}
{"text":"It's a McDonalds, not good, not bad. Playplace was clean, and the people were nice.\nI iwsh I could say more about it but nothing stands out, just food, typical temp, typical employees."}
{"text":"It is scary when they know what you're going to order as soon as you walk in? Yes, I've been here more than a few times"}
{"text":"McDonalds isn't only an ugly looking restaurant, but also has bad food. My friend ordered a salad and found a dead bee. I ordered a Big Mac and I think it is safe to say it was disgusting. Only 15% of their burgers are real meat and the other 85% is pink slime that can cause cancer. I suggest not eating there. Again. The staff is horrible they are a bunch uneducated idiots who ripped off my double decker cheeseburger. Oh and let me just tell you about the food. I bit into the burger and felt the texture of caviar. At first I was surprised then disgusted to find a huge spider crawling out of the burger. I had bitten the eggs and went into the ICU. My experience with that dump was absolutely disgusting. People are idiots."}
{"text":"exactly what the stars say. MEH. i realize that it is just mcdonalds, but i have definitely experienced better. everytime i come through here the employees are very monotonous and the fries are cold. seriously, the fries are the best part of mcdonalds; the least you could do is give me a decent order of hot, salty deliciousness!"}
{"text":"This McDonalds is currently under new ownership and has made tremendous improvements.\nThe drive thru is much faster and there is a whole new staff inside the restaurant. The shake/sundae machine is new and works wonderfully... Give this McDonalds another try if you haven't been here recently!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Again, another Summerlin McD's just doesn't cut it. The burgers were tasty (and at least not dry) but not hot. They were just a bit over room temperature. Granted, business was slow when we arrived, with only two other guests. Not sure if we will come back here again. If we do, maybe we should take our food home and microwave it just a bit. Ugh."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru for my kids today, line was a little longer than normal due to construction. But the staff was so friendly and smiley. Food was fresh and our order was correct despite picky eaters. Apparently the new owners are making big steps to make people happy! Even got a coupon for a BOGO breakfast item as an apology for the construction mess. Thumbs up guys!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to pick up a side salad to take home rather than make a salad from scratch.  The line at the drive through went very slowly.  I should have parked and walked in.\n\nThe salad was fresh and with my own dressing it made a great addition to my meal.\n\nThe only problem I have with this McDonald's is the ease of getting in and out.  It isn't easy.  because of the way it sits in Boca Park, the drive through is in the back and you need to watch traffic going to other stores in the next section.  It's not the most easy space."}
{"text":"This location is convenient in Boca Park, but be prepared to wait in the drive thru.  I have visited them during peak hours and between and that doesn`t seem to matter."}
{"text":"McDonald's is my go to breakfast joint when I go golfing in the morning.  I grab a couple of Sausage McMuffin's with Cheese so I can fill up before a round of golf.  Since I was golfing at the Badland's Golf Course nearby, I dropped by this location.  I went through the drive thru and it was very fast and efficient and they got my order correct.\n\nOverall, A-OK for a fast food joint.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%"}
{"text":"THEY ABSOLUTELY WORST... usually dont do chain restaurants, however multiple bad experiences will cause me to write this review. Last vist was on 8/20/14 around 2:30pm. Went in to get my girl a Ice tea, it was me and one other couple in line. As we waited for about 5 min for someone to come and talk to us (we watched multiple employees look directly at us and say nothing, like we were inconveniencing them). I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and tell myself that they are very busy lol and go to the bathroom. After a 10 min dump I came back out to attempt to order my ice tea. Same result. I am the only one standing there and now its time to cause some friction. I asked \"HELLO ANYONE HOME\"? No one came to check if I needed service, they did look at me, but no one attempted to say anything.  I said \"you have got to be fucking kidding me\" NOTHING. I couldn't take it anymore as I have been in the same situation at this place before. I stormed out upset, but i guess there are worse things in the world as me not getting my iced tea. I would advise you try the Wendy's up the street, at least they acknowledge you as a customer. This is the second time I have called the corporate office with the promise of something and the delivery of nothing. Please if you want to know how NOT to run a fast food business, come here for training."}
{"text":"Consistently the worse McDonalds I have seen.  It has been that way for years!  Worthless management / ownership.  Go anywhere else..."}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer at McDonalds for some time now and recently moved to the Summerlin area. This sorry excuse for a McDonalds near my house has continued to have the worst customer service, wait time is horrible and by all means hope and pray they get your order right!!!! There is plenty of competition, I'd would be happy to take my business else where! McDonalds? What happen the the customer service and quick service?!!"}
{"text":"Just wanted a large diet coke on my way home.... But no one would answer the drive thru at 10:54pm.  I decided to pull up to the window and saw am employee climbing in the window from the outside.... Still wanting my diet coke; I pulled up to the window and all of the employees scattered and hid from me.   Um.... so I left without my diet coke."}
{"text":"This was quite possibly the worst customer service I have ever had from a McDonalds which is saying a lot.  I went through the drive through and they did not include a double cheeseburger in the bag which I discovered after I got home.  Frustrated, I called and said I would like to return the incomplete order and get my money back and they refused.  When I went to confront the manager, she had taken her name badge off so that I could not find out what her name was and she called security.  I was escorted out without ever receiving my complete order and was denied my money back.  If I could give this place 0 stars I would.\n\n\nUpdate:  The next morning after calling the customer service number on the receipt I was told that if I returned to the store (for the third time), had my receipt, and still had the food I could have my money back.  I returned to the store, was apologized to, got my money back, and will never go back to that store again."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times  in the last two months and each time the ice cream machine is not working.  Hmmm.  What are the odds? Rather the employees don't want to be bothered by having to deal/clean the machine. And if you're machine is \"not working\", how about a little sign on your menu board stating that little fact so people aren't stuck sitting trapped in the drive thru line?"}
{"text":"For some reason everything time I come through the drive threw, they are slow and rude. Wonder what's happening inside smh"}
{"text":"This place is crazy busy .. I guess bec of the location and they have that kid playland thing."}
{"text":"I don't think anything of this place. It's Mickey D's!!! It's consistent w/ the food. Service is friendly. They are not 24 hrs so that is my only complaint."}
{"text":"I payed a visit to this location's drive thru today and really wasn't impressed.\n\nWhen I arrived at the window to pay for the order I placed the guy opened the window and just stared at me. I had to ask him how much I owed so that I could pay for my order. I guess he just assumed I could understand anything he might have uttered through their high quality drive thru speakers.\n\nThe drive through service was extremely slow. This is one of those places that make you wish you would have parked and walked in because you probably would have gotten your food faster.\n\nThe food was typical McDonalds...nothing special."}
{"text":"the worst mcdonald me and my family visit ever!!! the store manager on duty 02/13/16 at 5:34pm is the worst store manager i ever dealt with!!! will not be back to this store i rather go to wendy in the same shopping complex to eat next time with my family"}
{"text":"How happy am I that McDonald's started doing all day breakfast. Extremely happy. sometimes I wake up and I rushed to McDonald's to get there before 10 a.m. just to get breakfast but now I don't have to get there by 10 a.m. . my first meal of the day even if it's at 12 o'clock noon or 1 p.m. I consider it breakfast time. My favorite is the sausage McMuffin with egg. and the price you can't beat it. Two for $3 and change. I'm loving it."}
{"text":"They just redid this McDonald's. The play place and seating area is great. They also have daily specials. Kids happy meals are only 1.99 on weekends. Check your order because every time we have been they miss items we paid for."}
{"text":"The manager Yuselle was so awesome. My daughter wanted to spend her birthday at a Mcdonalds and when I inquired, Yuselle was more than happy to accomodate us even if they no longer host parties. He made the Playplace like our own space with complimentary balloons and decor. Justin assisted with the food orders and was really helpful in this area. \n\nThe place is newly renovated and not crowded at all because of its big area and updated furniture and fixtures."}
{"text":"This is the worst McDonald's I've been to. The service is always horrible. The only reason I ever go there is because it's the closest location to my home. Also it's obvious that the management is to blame. The workers are lazy and have no manners never say thank you. I don't usually write bad reviews but people need to know not to go here and this will be my last time too."}

It's pretty chill on Monday nights.\n\nStar 4: It's McDonalds man. Who can beat the dollar menu?!\n\nI love it when the fries are still hot when you eat 'em.. They weren't this time.."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and skip this McDonald's, I went in and ordered 2 iced coffees, as I waited for my order, they called every # except mine...people from the drive thru kept coming in and returning their orders, this McDonald's is completely unorganized so save yourself some time and a headache and go to another one.  We ended up tossing our coffees, it tasted a little tart for my liking."}
{"text":"I know I'm going to lose any credibility I've built for this review but I don't care. Why a 5 stars?  Because I can't give six stars for my beloved 99c soft serve ice cream. It's the best desert I can think of after any meal. If I could purchase their machine and recipe for the ice cream, It would be sitting in my kitchen this minute. \n\n99c for 99 calories of perfect treat. I know there are tons of soft serve ice cream out there but Micky D makes it just right to my taste. Packed at least 6 inches high on a tiny cone. It's not to watery, not too creamy. Not too soft and not too hard. Not too sweet. It takes me 10 minutes to get through the whole cone and I do savor those 10 minutes. How many deserts can you think of that takes more than 3 minutes to devour. Pies, cakes, puddings, cookies nope! Ah..If only I can have a cone now...\n\n(Note: That's why I befriended Mike P.

{"text":"Before dining I observe like a lead wolf scouting the best possible slot for the highly anticipated kill and feeding.    The choice was easy Since only one outlet was available and this wolf was at 3% battery and needs to get his Yelp on.  Interesting artwork in the dining room or as he locals call it \"kids room.\"   Food was fast and looked as if it as was made right from the picture.   They even offer the silverware in a \"take home\" option.  Brilliant.  I enjoyed this very much.  All I expected and more.   Hats of to the Chef Ronald and team!!!  \n\nEdit:  meal had a hash-brown but made the sacrifice of being eaten before the photo.  Someone had to,  I had to eat... :/)"}
{"text":"I took my two daughters to this McDonald's today, to get them out of the house for a bit and let them play. My daughter slid on the floor and hit her nose on a table. Her nose was bleeding profusely, a sweet little family that was there eating came over to offer help. The drive thru attendant came out of his little room and went and got us ice and told us he would inform the manager. He came back with the ice And said his manager was too busy to come out? Really someone gets hurt and they don't even come out to make sure the child is ok? Unreal! The manager finally came out with the offer to get more napkins. An urgent care visit, an emergency room visit and 8 hours later came the official diagnosis of a broken nose. :( \nBut really McDonald's why not show a little kindness towards your customers?!"}
{"text":"It's McDonalds. Cheap, quick breakfast. That's about its use. They have free wifi if you like this place."}
{"text":"Must be new ownership:management. This place was like a Forbes 4 star restaurant (and I work at one). \n\nThe employees were bending over backwards to be outgoing, kind and really nailing the service. 3 visits in a row.\n\nThey even made me an Americano. Can you believe?"}
{"text":"Rude, sloow crew. You would think that when the place is empty you could run in and out. Instead employees ignore you, even if you ask for service directly. Stay away."}
{"text":"When all you have to do is select an icon to complete a patrons order one should expect that service would be good.  Somehow they never seem to get it right."}
{"text":"The drive thur here can be nuts depending on the time of day. Watch out for the jerks that think they can come in from the back side of the drive thru when it's busy too! And if you're one of the jerks that lets them in when people have been waiting in line, I will yell at you or flip my hands up at you, it's not a zipper people ( you know how a zipper works) \n\nThe play area is a favorite for my kids. \n\nHere is the trick for super hot fries: Order them with no salt. This way they have to drop a whole new basket, because the other fries are all salted! Then you get the hottest fries ever! You can add the salt yourself! \nJust don't do this in the drive thru because it holds up the line, and yes, you guessed it, I will yell at you!!!!"}
{"text":"I do not know how they do it but this place is a goldmine.  The employees are always professional and this is one and only McDonalds that gets my order right every time.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I hate fast food but occasionally my daughter wants pancakes, so today when I went they had a horribly long line as usual, from the time I ordered my meal to actually getting it it took 17 minutes, and I only had 2 cars in front of me, when I finally got my order and I was checking it because after all the wait I didn't want it to be wrong the lady at the window told me to move my car because others are waiting. Really like I didn't wait enough. Ugh not only do they always have trouble hearing your order but they are so rude."}
{"text":"I have passed through this restaurant over 10x on my way to appointments and I finally stopped to have a meal. The staff is very pleasant and friendly. The location is small and I feel they could utilize the space more effectively to seat more people. The restaurant has a children's play area which I think is great cause kids hate to wait. The food storage area is right near the children's play area so I don't think that's to safe. The tables are very nicely set and simple except very small so if yore ordering a lot you may find yourself crowded. Our food took half an hour to be served after ordering. I only seen 1chef on the griddle so that was the hold up. \nThe Cr√™pe: we ha the Canada and Switzerland an it was so delicious. The expresso coffee was on point! I recommend everyone stop in and try it, it's worth the wait. The prices are reasonable and affordable. They make to go bags also!! I live in Blue Diamond NV so you know it's worth it if I drive that far on non appointment days. By the way upstairs of the restaurant has tons of Boutiques and shops. My personal favorite is BOX Human landscapers. Check them out !!"}

{"text":"This location is a really nice McDs.  What a pleasant surprise!\n\nI was in the area running some errands when my daughter wanted lunch.  I always cave in due to my ridiculous love of McNuggets, so we popped in for lunch.  The place was busy, but everything seemed to be flowing at a nice pace.  We didn't have to wait too long to order or for our food, which is always nice with a hungry toddler.  When we did get our food, it was piping hot and super yummy!  And I do know it is bad for me, but those gosh darn McNuggets, I tell you they have cast a spell on me!\n\nNow the real reason we go to McDs is so my daughter can play and interact with other little ones since she is an only child...So I really gauge my writing on how nice the play area is at each McDs, in all honesty.  \n\nFirst off, the play area was really clean.  I wasn't afraid to let my daughter go play.  I didn't feel the need to put her in a biohazard suit, so that is a big plus. This McDs has a huge play area with 2 sections for extra fun.  They have your regular climbing tubes and slides for your bigger kids.  If your toddlers are climbers, like my little monkey, they can handle these tubes fine as well.  The have a mini slide for extra little ones as well, which is nice because they don't have to be around all of the big kids, if they are on  the timid side.  They also had a whole separate climbing section that toddlers or big kids could play on.  It is nice for the kiddos to have so many play options.  \n\nThere was also a lot of seating, so we didn't have to fight for a seat.  It isn't fun to have to stand and wait for someone to leave just so you can sit down.\n\nOverall, this is a nice fast food place.  Go check it out, if you need a quick bite to eat or have kids you need to wear out for their nap."}
{"text":"Ok yeah so I eat fast food from time to time. What?!\n\nThis McD's is close to my house, and I've noticed recently (like the last few weeks) that they have been charging more for extras. Before, getting extra sauce on the Jalapeno McDouble was free. Now they charge $0.19 for extra sauce. Extra sauce on the Buffalo and Ranch McChicken is $0.19 for the ranch, and $0.30 for the buffalo. WTH. Two different charges?! And it's not like you are getting a tub of sauce on the side like for Mc Nuggets (which they charge $0.25 btw); it's just a squirt!\n\nAlso if you ask for extra pickle, it's $0.25, but if you ask for them on the side it's $0.50. -__-\n\nNote that they did not charge extra for the sauces a few weeks ago. I have receipts to prove it.  And the pickle thing? Ridiculous. Almost all other Mcd's don't charge for extra anything unless you get extra cheese or meat. Even the ghetto locations close to the Strip.\n\nYou guys pissed me off with your nickel and diming. If I want to get my fatty on, it's not going to be at this location."}
{"text":"I ordinarily don't have a problem with this Mcdonalds besides the long drive thru lines but the rating I'm giving to it is based solely on the manager that they had working during the time I ordered my food. Today 10/09/2016 at about 8:30 PM I ordered there through the drive thru. The man who took my order was friendly and took my order correctly. I paid normally but when I was given my food from the man working there I realized I had received the wrong bag of food. I ordered 20 nuggets, a small fry and a large fry. In the bag I was handed was 40 nuggets and a small fry. I took all the boxes of nuggets out of my bag to verify that I was missing my large fries and waited at the drive thru window for the individual to come back so I could address the issue about the additional nuggets and no large fries. After letting him know he asked for my receipt which I handed to him. Keep in mind that the order on my receipt was correct and exactly what I ordered. This is when the manager stepped in about the incorrect order and began interrogating me. She was a short heavy set woman with really bad food handling practices. She asked what I was given so I told her too many nuggets and no large fries. She then told me that she needed all that food back which surprised me. So as she requested, I placed all the  nugget boxes back into the bag and handed it to her. Then she went off to do whatever it was that she does, leaving me with the guy who eventually gave me another bag of food. I asked this guy if that was the manager and he said yes. The bag he gave me was also missing my small fries. I told him and he corrected it on the spot only after she belittled him and he was saying to her that I just checked the bag and there was no small fries like she said there was. Ultimately, She wasn't rude but the thing that bothered me is that I'm almost positive that she gave those nuggets from my car to someone else which is absolutely disgusting and not good food practices. I wouldn't say my car is dirty but I've seen some nasty vehicles and to think that she believes that it's perfectly acceptable to ask for food back after someone else has put there hands all over it? That's outrageous. Who's to say that I didn't open those boxes and put my hands on the nuggets? Maybe I ate a few? This should have never happened and she needs to be fired or demoted. From my experience with fast food places, if they mess up your order then they will let you keep whatever they messed up or throw it away. This was not the case. Overall, I'm disappointed and hope that she receives reprimand."}
{"text":"I love this location. They are so fast most of the time and never mess up my order. Workers don't seem bitter and are never rude. Always a great experience."}
{"text":"Out of all carbonated drinks and it's not the firs time. And when I asked for a lemonade they wants to charge me extra. I told them that was not fair and over 59 cents they refused. Add to that they are always on a long wait and don't have a great track record for getting food orders correctly, why go there. I went at 7:30 on a Sunday  March 6th 2014 so hopefully someone reads this and has a talk with the brainiac manager working that doesn't realize all their customers r regulars and u should be better to them. I guess because the name is McDonalds they don't have to take care of us. Oh if u want to call because of anything including wrong orders, no answer."}
{"text":"So irritating. I just left there...had a simple order, large sweet tea and a large iced vanilla coffee. I just drove off and was on my way home. I put the straw in and before I took a sip. I always check the bottom of the coffee to see if there are any coffee grains. I checked and no grains but there was a hair, a curly hair at that. I was already close to my house and didn't want to turn around. Such a waste. \nThanks a lot to who ever made my drinks."}
{"text":"I wish that there was a option for no stars.this is the worst McDonald anyone can find!!Everytime we go there they NEVER get the order right,their either missing a shake,get the drinks wrong.the last few times we've been they always mess up a happy meal(really,how can they mess a happy meal up).by the time we get home,and realize they messed up my daughters food,I call and then they question me about it and I have to PROVE that they messed it up.i get so upset because this time I waited in the drive thru for 30 mins.I really wish that someone get a New Mcdonalds closer to my home,because they next closest one is on W.Ann.please if you plan on a no stress dinner just cook at home and skip the frustration"}
{"text":"Wow, they are earning their bad reputation. Four pieces of chicken in a six piece order. Really??"}
{"text":"Don't go to this location the employees are rude and are not customer service oriented at all I got the food it was cold and hard if I could I'd give them no stars"}
{"text":"The worst McDonald's in town longest lines horrible service.......... my kids hate the place now"}
{"text":"Great job, guys.   You just lost a rave, 5 star review and a loyal customer.\n\nMy husband goes twice a week at least after working out to get a soda and a cup of water.  Cup of water is always free EVERYWHERE, until now...now you have to pay $1 for the cup (which is extra dumb, because a cup of soda there is $1...I guess soda's free and we're just paying for cups at McDonalds).\n\nI'd understand if he just walked in and asked for free water, but he was a paying customer, and they know him there as he's a regular.\n\nAlso, very convenient that they suddenly start charging for tap water right when the hot summer weather hits.  Shameful."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is in my neighborhood, so I wind up going there on a fairly regular basis to grab food for the family. It's usually busy, but my main issues have been with the drive-through service. Two out of the last three times I have gone through, I have had to go into the restaurant to get items that I had paid for but were omitted from my order. For some reason it usually seems to be a Happy Meal (which I order for my grandson). On one occasion they left it out but gave me the milk I ordered with it. The second time they gave me a small iced tea with it (which I didn't order), charged me $1.29 for the milk that was supposed to come with the Happy Meal at no cost, and left out the Happy Meal itself."}
{"text":"This location is ridiculous. I've never been until today because every day after 3p the line wraps out into the parking lot. Well, I've learned that the same thing happens in the mornings.\n\nI waited behind 6 cars for about 15 minutes before ordering. When I did order, the cashier tried to overcharge me for items I wasn't ordering. I had to drive to the window to get the order right. Then they charged me extra at the second window for condiments.\n\nIf you want to be overcharged and wait 15 to 30 minutes to get lukewarm, mediocre fast food, come to this drive through."}
{"text":"I brought my son here to grab a quick bite to eat one very hot afternoon. It was nice that they have the air conditioned indoor play ground that seemed pretty clean. The food of course, isn't the healthiest but they do have better choices now. I got my son the apple slices instead of frys, and juice instead of soda. Of course he preferred to play then eat so he just ate when we got back home.\n\nI had the honey mustard grilled chicken mini meal, which was just average."}
{"text":"Seriously, every time I come here they always forget something (I usually check, figures).  Burgers & no fries, 3 miles alway...hell no I'm not coming back they should deliver when they are in error.  SMH, amateur hour over there"}
{"text":"In order to get a large drink you have to get a large meal.... but all drinks are $1. It's the owners choice. It is so stupid. Just seems like a way to get a few more pennies. This place is always busy so I can't see why they need to nickel and dime people. Maybe they should worry more about training their employees in customer service."}
{"text":"At this location, the service is very slow and most of their workers can't even speak english! The food quality is poor! There are lots of other McDonald's in Vegas and they are way better. Don't waste your time going to this McDonald's go to better ones!"}
{"text":"I used to love this McDonald's and it's actually a few cents cheaper then the one on cenntenial. After yesterday though I will no longer support this store. \n\nMy wife stopped by hear yesterday to get myself and a few of my troops lunch then bring it out to us at work. Placing the order went fine and she got the food. Since it was a large order and she had to drive it out to us 20 minutes away she didn't stop to check it. \n\nWhen she delivered the food we found that a double quarter pounder was missing. No big deal I've been missing food from McDonald's before and gone back to get it. No not today when my wife gets to McDonald's and shows them the receipt and explains what happens they refuse to do anything about it. The manager tells my wife it's her fault for not checking the order for leaving. Isn't it your employees jobs to make sure the prder is completely filled out before you hand it to the customer? \n\nNow I'm out $5 because the manager refused to refund or give my wife another burger. Well we called the complaint line about it and complained thinking maybe we will be able to get them to send us a gift card for $5 or something, nope that's not happening either. So now we are out $5 for food we didn't even get. I know $5 isn't much but it's the fact that the store did nothing to right the wrong."}
{"text":"Please have your staff put a glove when handing out the ice cream cone to customers. Their always touching the top cones with their bare hands."}
{"text":"Officially the WORST location! I try and stay away from this location buts it's literally the closest to my house with a 3 min drive. Their customer service sucks, their menu sucks, and their food sucks! Items they don't SHOW on the menu are no longer offered yet any other location I go to has them still. Like the Club sandwich. Just because they don't list it doesn't mean they don't have it. Then when you ask about it their management doesn't even bat an eye or even turn around to look at their customers before they cut their cashiers off and say flat out no. Their food is even worse! Burnt or dry old fries, cold nuggets, and at best half flat soda. Will me making the drive to Ann and 95 frwy from now on."}
{"text":"Its McDonalds, what is there really to say!! \nThis location could potentially get 5 stars but its always always\nbusy!! \nNot sure how much of it is slowness behind the counter or just being \nlegitimately busy. \nEither way, I live close so this is typically my mcdonalds of choice!"}
{"text":"So far the staff is friendly but the girl at the register seems to be in training.  The place is clean.  I Ordered two kids meals and asked for extra pickles .25 on each burger, I'm surprised they didn't charge for no onions lmbo let's not give them any ideas.  They offer chocolate milk for kids meals but upcharge you for a drink.  I have never in all the years at eating at McDonalds been charged for extra tartar sauce on my fish filet.  Glad I don't usually eat McDonald's and definitely won't be eating it again after today."}
{"text":"Well, this is clearly NOT Burger King, and you can not have it your way. \n\nFor some reason asking for extra coffee sweetener in your coffee means \"please don't put any cream, sugar, or sweetener in my coffee\". \n\nSame goes for light sweetener. \"Please put as much sweetener as you can in my coffee)\n\nStaff is rude and slow. Business inside is not as clean as one would hope... But it's McDonald's, so I guess expectations shouldn't be high there. \n\n\"Fast food drive thru\" is ANYTHING but fast... So if you're planning on grabbing a snack or something on the way to work, give yourself and extra 30 minutes."}
{"text":"So we all know its Mcdonalds; big deal, right! Well this place never disappoints! The food is always hot and fresh and they always get my order right. The drive thru is pretty busy but moves fast. So that means you'll have hot fries!  This location is better than the one near Durango/Centennial."}
{"text":"There is a lot to be said about this McDonald's. The chicken is great. I love the fresh fruit in the yogurt parfait and if you ever give me hot fries you will see me do my odd but strange happy dance. And this McDonald's has seen the dance of I'm so happy I just have no shame dance about a million times. Oh and the ice creme cones are only a dollar bill. Sure they are extra busy at this location but that's a Plus can u say hot and ready food."}
{"text":"We just celebrated my sons 2nd birthday at this particular location and the party was AMAZING!! \n\nI know when you think of McDonald's, no big deal right? Well, this one is special! Since we have a very rambunctious 2 year old we have tested almost every McDonald's Playland in the city - this one passes the test with him! We were looking for a location to hold his 2nd birthday and we were running short on ideas since many of the things to do in Las Vegas/Henderson are geared toward older children. In my search for a birthday location I found this McDonalds on a website that lists all the great playgrounds/playlands in the city and it had many great reviews so I called to ask if they did birthday parties and unfortunately (at the time I called) they said that they did not. I was seriously bummed - and continued on with my search. One day we decided to take our son to this McDonalds just to burn some energy. I swear once we walked through the sliding glass doors and my son saw the playland, it was like the heavens opened up and his eyes got HUGE!! So much to do, so little time! This McDonalds was perfect for him, it is equally split between a toddler area (4 years and under) and their normal ginormous playland for older kids (4-99.) The playland is immaculate and obviously very well cared for. I decided to ask again if they hosted birthday parties and the manger said yes they did! I was ecstatic, we had found our perfect party location! It turns out they were doing birthdays and had stopped for a while and JUST started doing them again around my sons birthday...lucky us! All that was required of us at the time was a small deposit of $40 and a guesstimated count of how many children will be attending. \n\nThe day of my sons birthday was flawless, not a hitch and and not an issue that might be expected of a fast food restaurant. I got to the location early to decorate and to my (totally pleasant) surprise it was already decorated and I had my own \"hostess\" to help me with whatever I needed help with. Our party had separate seating with balloons, party hats and a banner. Our hostess went around and took individual orders and took care of EVERYTHING which allowed me to really socialize with the parents and spend precious birthday time with my son. We had an equal amount of toddlers and older kids and they were equally having fun. After we all ate (the norm Micky D's selection of food) the hostess brought out a cake large enough for all of us and ice cream too. It was time for the bill and I was so surprised to find that I was only asked to pay for the individual meals we ordered and anything beyond that was just a part of having the party there. All in all it was a fabulous day, my son had a wonderful time and so did his guests. I am so glad I decided to ask if they did birthday parties again!! \n\n**On a side note, we took our son to this same location to meet Ronald McDonald a few weeks before his party and we were able to meet the franchise owner of this particular location. She was very hospitable and cared very much about the children there. It is very clear why this particular McDonalds is so well taken care of."}
{"text":"I will give this McDonald's 3 stars because the place is always clean and the staff is really pleasant. The food is what you would expect for McDonald's. I'm writing this review because one particular time I went there, there was a guy complaining because he had to come all the way back because they messed up his order. He spoke to one of the managers and they wouldn't even give him a free \"anything\" for his inconvenience. I know that they aren't in the business of giving away food but if there were no customers, there wouldn't be any business. I feel you need to treat your customers right."}
{"text":"They just can't follow direction in getting an order right. If these kids are our future...we're in trouble."}
{"text":"I used to spend a lot of time eating drive thru. We are talking 3 times a day, 7 days a week. During that three years, I ate here at least 4 times a week, between breakfast, lunch and dinner. About 10 months ago I stopped eating fast-food all together, including McDonald's. At that time, the level of service that this particular McDonald's provided was on a slow decline.\nIt started when I made the shift from double quarter pounders to grilled chicken salads. frequently, hell almost every time, I would not get utensils in my bag. So, I started asking at the speaker and at each window for utensils. Every time, I would get down the road, be rummaging through my bag, only to find that again I had no fork.\nMy troubles did not stop there. Twice I got a salad, only to find that I could not eat it because the chicken was under cooked. If you know anything about working at McDonald's like I do (I worked my first job for 4 years at a McDonald's in KY), then you know it is hard to under cook grilled chicken. It is almost something you have to do deliberately. None the less, I am patient, so I did not complain.\nPeriodically towards the end of my fast-food stent, the service level was going in the you know whatter. They had hired some 'new recruits' who were obviously to young and cool to care about the customers that they serve. I got full flavor of the chips on their shoulders every time i drove through. I knew that I was coming to the end of my fast food stage, so I just let it go and stopped eating fast food.\nNow, three days ago my brothers (who i live with), wanted to get McDonald's for dinner. I wound up getting it for them, though I was not getting any myself, cause I'm just that kinda guy. I go through drive thru, like always, and I can't believe it. Not only did I wait at the speaker for almost 3 minutes before anyone picked up, while there were no cars in front of me, but when I got around to pay, there was nobody at EITHER window. I waited, and waited, and waited some more. Finally after another 4 minutes, someone came to the second window scolding me for not stopping at the first window (which for the record I did stop for about 2 minutes). They were obviously having a bad day, and for whatever reason decided to take it out on yours truly. But that is not all. I finally get the food, make the short 2 minute trip home, get in the house, give my brothers the food, start telling them the horror story of our once favorite burger joint, and they stop me. They stop me to tell me that the food was so cold that they could not eat it. We wound up having spaghetti because it was just not eatable. Fail.\nI waited, hoping that I would just get over it, like I always to, but my voice has to be heard. This is simply outrageous. To think that in 10 short months, a restaurant can go from a family favorite to the worst place in the area is just unsatisfactory. Fail"}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's I've ever been to. The cashier we had was not friendly or welcoming!! And there is a sign posted that says \" Please limit your visit to one hour\" When coming with kids they want to play for awhile before and after they eat. I've never seen a sign like this at any other McDonald's!!!"}
{"text":"When you walk out of Dundas West Station, it smells like McDonalds. You think you might have an actual Mac, but you are so wrong. This store is probably smaller than your bathroom, and does not have a bathroom (CRIES IN DESPAIR! Now you have to cross the street and go to The Crossways Mall!) and the only thing I might recommend there is grabbing a cup of tea if your streetcar is delayed."}
{"text":"I mean, honestly. It doesn't get better than this. My friend and I ordered nuggets and asked for extra sauce on the side and they gave us a whole BAG of sauces. Like, there were probably 20 sauces in that bag. Is there anything better than that? Sauce for days. DAYS!"}
{"text":"I think the set up this McDonald's at Dundas West Station is kind of cute and different. I just think it is a great idea to have half the counter in the paid area or even have a McDonald's in a subway station.\n\nFrankly, I would not have get anything from McDonald's if I am outside station, but if I am inside waiting to board a streetcar.. the smell of french fries and meat can be quite tempting."}
{"text":"Far too many tweens working at, and surrounding this McDonald's.  Lots of Bieber bobs and One Direction shirts.  Not too much Taylor Swift.  Tweens scare the seniors and they make the station sticky!  Tweens always linger and drop straw wrapper on the ground at this station.\n\nI tried the poutine here and it was just, spectacular.  Good portion size, good cheese-gravy ratio, not too salty; it was on point. From 3:30-5:30 it's like a tween haven so brace yourself. When I see the McDonald's inventory sitting on the ground in the Subway station, I'm like, some tween is gonna steal it. \n\n3 Stars!"}
{"text":"It's really small in here but the staff are nice and they work hard. There's definitely NOT even enough room to breathe though. Really convenient that it's located in the subway station (like St. Clair) though. There is also wifi."}
{"text":"I'll give credit where credit is due: if more subway stations had restaurants, Toronto would be a happier place. this location being in the middle of the west side of the Bloor line(say THAT three times fast) is a diamond in the rough. not only does it serve the inside of the station, but also has a partition in the middle of the waiting area to separate the inside of the station from the outside. although this location is a bit slower then normal, the hours that it is open is amazing. the staff are really good for all of the service they have to go through with the general public."}
{"text":"it is what it is. McD's.. I hadn't had a meal in over two years but since there were no healthier options on the run. I grabbed a junior McChicken sandwich. Everything was hot and service was fast."}
{"text":"Inside the Dundas West station... is the  tiniest McDonalds ever! It's more of a counter than anything, so squeezing into the line at a busy time proves challenging. I was recently scolded by a guy accusing me of cutting him in line. I was merely standing beside him to avoid being hit by the door from behind. They do their best for a small joint. I like that there's actually good options in a subway station- more stations should adopt this idea; Just like subways in Asia! It's always a bit dangerous passing through this station as the scent of French fries always tempts me and tests my willpower."}
{"text":"I agree that the layout for this McDicks is a bit off but if you have a metropass it's awesome! \n\nSometimes there is a brutal lineup on the subway side, so you just walk outside and enter the other door and voila... No lines. \n\nGenerally speaking the service here is very quick and the location is super convenient for those who tend to sleep in and need breakfast before getting on the subway."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for 2 years for coffee in the morning. \nThey use to be so quick. In and out within 2 minutes if you just had coffee. \nNow it takes longer and longer each day. \nI was there this morning and I missed 3 buses. \nIt took 20 minutes to get 1 regular coffee. \nHighly suggest going else where if you are in a hurry   Location is going downhill"}
{"text":"These people work hard and its always busy as hell and its..McDonalds so you must know what you are getting yourself into before you visit. Its so funny watching the drunk fights on the other side of the glass when visiting after 1:30am on a Friday night."}
{"text":"It's kind of a weird layout here. It's inside the subway station, but you can access it from both sides of the gates. There's a glass wall that separates the restaurant in half so you can grab a burger either before or after you've paid your transit fare.\n\nOutside of that oddity, it's your regular old McD's and there's nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"This place has recently been rebuilt which is nice, but the men's bathroom is something else, super dirty! Trash cans in the restaurant are are always overflowing and there's always Hobo's hanging out in there, staff is slower than usual, order accuracy levels are in the toilet!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was just a bad day or if it's always been like this, but the service needed some work. Only one register open Witham long line of customers. Orders took really long and many were wrong. One customer returned get order 3 times until they got it right. Those with small orders had to wait am excess amount of time. Seemed as though drive-thru customers were top priority, while customers inside were unimportant."}
{"text":"It's about time they re-did this place. I mean, how many McDonald's that are out there that are just straight up drive thrus that are wildly popular and successful? None if any. \n\nSo why this review for a chain? Well, since it's new I wanted to check it out and get my McRib grub on since it only comes around every so often. You would think the service would be nice just like the building but here's where the needle on the record scratches off the vinyl.\n\nFirst thing, I get in line behind one person that is waiting to order their food. A couple minutes go by and finally after the just the one counter person calls out somebody's order, he takes the person's order that is in front of me. So after that order, he leaves to go get it ready while I'm standing there waiting to get my order in. Btw, this was lunchtime around 11:30 so there is a line already forming. You would think that there would be at least 2 to 3 people at the counter for the lunch rush but no. This one guy was doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nSo I finish meal and throw away my mess. I go to the bathroom to wash my hands. I come back out to get a refill on my coke. This employee refilling the soda lids asks me if I have my receipt so I can get my refill. I reply saying that I just got done eating and just came from the bathroom. The receipt is in the garbage. He says I can't get a refill. EXCUSE ME? DID YOU NOT JUST SEE ME SITTING AT THE VERY TABLE YOU JUST CLEANED? So I got my refill after the guy says he was gonna report me to his manager. I said go ahead so I can complain about the bad customer service. He just stood there and continued to refill the lids for the soda. I should of said, \"Do you know who I am? I am Roger T and I'm a Yelp Elite damnit! You better recognize!\" Lol.\n\nAnyways, just because it's a new building does not equal to great or better service. Next time, just give me my damn McRib and I'm out!"}
{"text":"I'll give this place 2 stars due to the gentleman running the front counter working very hard and doing his best to compensate for an obviously understaffed crew. Aside from that, my visit was a disaster from the moment I walked through the doors. A drink had been spilled on the trash receptacle inside the door and had run all over the floor. Speaking of the floor, there was food and trash strewn all over the floor, and it looked as though it had not been mopped in some time. The drink counter, much like the floor, wash trash strewn with bags, napkins and straw wrappers, though there were no straws available. This should have been my first clue, but I needed something safe and quick to eat, and chose McDonald's though I haven't eaten in one for quite some time. Sadly, I regretted my decision to stay and order shortly after receiving my food. The fries were barely lukewarm, and the burger (a McDouble) was dry and had obviously been sitting around. So much for McDonald's push for fresher food. Methinks it will be another number of years before I dare to try this culinary horror, if ever..."}
{"text":"This by far the rudest McDonalds I've ever been to. I was the only one there and they acted like I was a bother to to them. They greeted me with \"what do u need ?\"\nIt was downhill from there."}
{"text":"This mcdonalds shouldn't even deserve a star it's very messy and the workers are very rude and lazy"}
{"text":"First time in a long time I have stopped in at a Mc Donald's, the staff was friendly. I get my order from the drive thru get home and my hamburgers are burnt..."}
{"text":"The remodel was long overdue, and it's super fancy. The pictures speak a thousand words. Also service has been great here!"}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't write up a chain restaurant, but I have to say my dining experience was very much enhanced by the recent renovation.  They went from a classic drive-in setup where you place your order at the window and dine in your car or in their outdoor seating to a true \"McCafe\" complete with faux blue chandelier, ultra-modern bathroom doors and interior decor, and bright high definition animated menus which would make Marty McFly (see what I did there?) wonder if he set the wrong year on his Delorean going from his mother Lorraine's time in 1956 to 2016.  There's a service monitor that displays the order number brightly and service was prompt and courteous.  I ordered Le McRib with a side of pomme frites and sweet tea (or as I may one day learn to call it, liquid diabetes) and in a simultaneously comforting and disturbing way, all items tasted identical to how I always remembered them.  Drive-through is very accessible off of Flamingo but if you need to get back heading toward the strip, U-turn is now mandatory off of Eastern."}
{"text":"If you're in a hurry for a cheeseburger you might try another location!\n\nThe location at Flamingo and Eastern is our neighborhood Macdonalds and with two small kids we stop here regularly for an ice cream to celebrate a good day at school.  We have used the drive thru dozens of times and this has to be the slowest franchise location of any my wife or I have ever visited.  I'm a fairly patient person however 8 out of 10 visits require 10 minutes or more in the drive thru even when there are only 3-4 cars ahead of us. \nIts gotten so bad that we either walk in, which is marginally faster, or we will drive 2 miles out of our way to go to another location. The franchise owner can really use a Macdonalds Universoty refresher course on the importance on speedy and cheerful customer service."}
{"text":"I usually get a sausage egg mcmuffin with no sausage, since I don't eat meat and ots cheaper then an egg mcmuffin no meat, I have gotten this for years at different McDonalds without a prpblem.  I have been getting it every Monday at this one for the last couple months with no problem.  Today I went through the drive thru and the girl argued with me aboit it saying it was stupid and that they couldn't do it. I went to the wimdow and asked for a Sup and had the window slammed shut on me, the person at the second window wouldn't even open it.  I called the number that was on my receipt from last week and there was no answer."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and kids.  Looked like friendly staff.  Food came out fast.... What else would you expect. When i finished,  i had to use the restroom. Mind you this was at approximately 1900,  or 7pm. It smelled horribly.  When i went to the stall,  where the smell was coming from,  seen human fesus on the tolet and floor. Told the manager,  she said she will get on it.  Came back at 9 pm to see,  it was still there"}
{"text":"So,  I went up here cause I had a free medium fry on the app. I ordered the fries and with the change I had ordered a sweet tea. So I went to get the sweet tea from the lobby (that's where its at now).  Tea tasted like garbage. And also,  the one guy behind the register (an older fellow) gave me a look of disgust. I informed the employee of the sweet tea. He said that he will tell a manager. Waited bout 25 minutes or so,  no sweet tea. Plus I noticed bunch of nats all over the soda fountain. They need to clean that or the health department will."}
{"text":"For starters....WHY would u have the door to the playland be pull in push out?   The kids can just push and run out and how with kids and a tray of food can you pull a door open?????  That was epically brilliant thinking.   Then I went to restroom and there's blood on floor and feces on the toilet seat and there's no toilet covers in site!   The staff was friendly but it's 11:45 on a Wednesday and there is only one register open....ill be back when I'm in Ohio because it's the only Playland for my friends kids ....but wise up guys!!!!!  change the door....."}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't bother to review a fast food place, since you generally know what you're going to get. The fact that it had a 1-star review, however, intrigued me. Could it really be that awful? I assumed it was probably staffed by lazy, uninterested high school kids, resulting in poor service and poor quality.\n\nI was surprised that this was not the case. The food was fresh and hot. Fries were appropriately salted. Service was a little slow for how empty it was inside, but by the temperature of my fries I assume it's because they were waiting for those to finish.\n\nThat said, the drive through entrance is in a really strange place. It looks like you're about to drive into a dumpster when suddenly it's visible. I couldn't understand why this McDonald's is reviewed so poorly! I went back and looked and realized what happened--someone gave it a 1-star review because the door to the playplace was push to exit. That's it. That's the whole reason. Previous Reviewer: I am sorry that whoever wronged you that day did so. This McDonald's was innocent. \n\nI sadly could be described as someone who \"knows McDonald's very well\" which is to say I have no class and legitimately enjoy fast food. The fact that I have written a 4 paragraph review should make that lack of class thing fairly obvious. I am giving it a 5-star review, not because it was a truly revelatory experience, but because that 1-star review is BS. Honestly, it's a 4-star. Slightly slow service, upper-tier food (for McDonald's).\n\nFor shame, Previous Reviewer."}
{"text":"I have been to this McDonald's in the heart of Corso Italia (@ Dufferin and St. Clair) a few times... And boy, let me tell you, it's the worst McDonald's I have ever experienced. \n\nWhy?  \n\nThe service is so ghastly sloooow!  There is always a long line of irritated customers. The best analogy I have for how slow this line moves is the attitude that Patty and Selma from The Simpsons have with their jobs at the DMV, \"Some days, we don't let the line move at all. We call those weekdays.\"  The army of staff behind the counter does not translate into fast service.  The staff aren't motivated and they seem to always to be set on \"chill\" mode. I have even seen them argue with each other in front of customers. \n\nWhat's even worse is that this location doesn't even serve the Fillet-o-Fish!  \n\nInstead, I got a Big Mac this visit which I suspect has gotten smaller in size than years past. \n\nNothing could salvage my experience today... Not even the fact that Monopoly is back!"}
{"text":"The worst mc Donalds of all time all of there employees should be fired every single one , lazy lazy people the manager too busy trying to pick up all the lil school girls coming in I never seen a mc donalds so bad have had hair in my food numerous times then I complain and get a free meal then I had to blow up on them jus to get it"}
{"text":"Where to start with this one. I have no problem with McDonald's at all but this one is just horrible. \n\nI went there on a Saturday morning at 7am and this place was still closed?!!! The elderly wanting their coffee and wanting to sit down have been waiting since 630. Most McDonald's open early and this one none in sight.\n\nI have no problem with teenagers working their but they seem like they dont want to be there and have the worse attitude when it comes with customers. They make the lines wait like crazy.\n\nThe bathroom are just the worse.\nNEVER NEVER NEVER TAKE KIDS TO THIS BATHROOM. \nThey have boxes for the druggies can put their needles and its easy for lil kids to grab them. My son asked me what there for. This is bad and unhealthy..\n\nThe crowd of druggies surrounds the front and picks fight with the customers and none does a thing. I got into a fight with one because he was trying to take my sons happy meal toy. \n\nTruthfully the best time to go is around 730am from monday to friday where its mature people working"}
{"text":"Okay So before i rant off, let me just say that i was almost gonna order a Big Extra because i read that they had it...but changed my mind and got a McChicken instead. So when i was just sitting there eating my not so tasty McChicken i was like \"Crap i shouldve gotten the Big Extra\". Ugh\n\nI wouldn't come back here personally i thought the place looked ranchy. The washrooms were a complete disaster and when i had gotten my order i noticed they didn't have napkins there i had to ask for some. I got about 2 serviettes. Im guessing they're cutting back?\n\n\nI just should've gotten the big extra, maybe none of this would've happened."}
{"text":"It's McDonalds, what can you say, right? I'm actually a McDonalds fan because if I only have $3 in my pocket I can still eat lunch without pulling out the plastic. This location, though, is usually a little slow on the service. You can expect a line up and you will most likely be waiting on something. The point of McDonalds is speediness. They should work on their staffing issues. On the latest trip I was seduced by the new Chicken McBites. Sadly when I got them they are just like McChicken (which I hate, dunno why they can't spice it like the junior) cut in little pieces. So bland. I got the habanero sauce as I like it hot and was also disappointed. It is quite hot but the flavor is vicious. Then I had to wait again in their line up to get a package of McChicken sauce to try to salvage the experience. Boo."}
{"text":"Horrible drive-thru service. \nAbsolutely stunned workers. \nLine ups 20 min wait.\nBrutal for fast food. \nNot even worth a star."}
{"text":"You can get a Big Xtra here, need I say more? Ok, I'll add a little more.\n\nThere are a couple McDonald's in the city where you can still get this gem of a burger. Sure you can order a quarter pounder and modify the toppings to make it a Big Xtra, but chances are that they won't get it quite right. This location has it on the menu. Awesome.\n\nThe cleanliness of the dining area can be hit and miss. Sometimes it's well maintained, other times, not so much.\n\nThe service here has never been overly quick. But they are friendly."}
{"text":"Let's just say, if you what fast food then this is definitely NOT the place for you at all !! Service is horrible, they really could care less if you get your order in a timely manner. Stay away !!!!"}
{"text":"So bad, I went and they wouldn't stop fighting! I mean literally screaming at each other about stealing from the register and swearing and talking about not being able to get fired for stealing cuz he won't be able to pay child support and how everyone's on drugs. Then the manager finally showed up... and started screaming and swearing too... so moral of the story: don't bring your kids and it's a good place if you want to get  ghetto jerry springer-Esque entertainment while eating."}
{"text":"I go to fast food places a few times a year, at best, so maybe my expectations are a little skewed, but my latest experience at McDonald's left a lot to be desired. There's really no use in rating the actual food, as it's hard to screw up food at a McDonald's. It's all subpar grub, but my penchant for getting filet-o-fish sandwiches this time of year lives on anyway, so I had to go satiate my once-a-year craving.\n\nMy issue was with the service. I walked in and the employees were just chatting it up with their friends and off-hours coworkers who were on the customer side of the counter. It was around 11pm and the lack of customers inside of the restaurant made it pretty obvious that I was the only person waiting for my order to be taken, but that didn't stop the employees behind the counter from finishing their conversations before taking my order.\n\nAfter I finally put my order in, I seemed to wait an eternity (in fast food terms) for my two filet-o-fish sandwiches, regular McBites, and medium french fry order. It was hardly a complicated order, but I've waited less time during peak hours at other fast food chains in the past. Thankfully, there was ONE girl working who saw me standing there for a long time, and asked, \"are his McBites up yet?...where are they?\" I was happy that someone had finally addressed the situation, but it shouldn't have taken that long.\n\nAgain, I'm aware that showing up at 11pm will probably increase my odds of walking into a late-night, preparing-for-the-next-day mess of a restaurant, but even in fast food, it's absurd to think that the level of cleanliness that I walked into is acceptable. Not to mention, the one girl who was working announcing that she was \"going to pee\"  while I was standing there. I wasn't offended at all, but I found it odd that she thought that was acceptable to say in front of a customer.\n\nI guess this experience reminded me of why I limit my trips to fast food chains as much as possible."}
{"text":"As I stated before , I don't review chain restaurants unless something is outstanding or horrible . Well , this place is beyond horrible . If I could give negative  stars I would . The food was typical McDonalds . Not good or bad . The service , however , was terrible . As I placed my order , the greeting I got was \" what do you want \" . The woman who waited on my obviously didn't finish the sixth grade and didn't care about manners . She was slow as molasses even though there were several people in line behind me . After taking time out to BS to a coworker about her weekend , she gave me my order and never said \" thankyou\" . I replied \" your welcome \" very loudly to make a point but got a mean stare in return . I asked to speak to manager but was told he was busy for next 15 minutes or so . I left and as I was driving away , I saw the manager and two other workers grabbing a smoke near the rear door . No wonder the service was horrible !!! Will never stop here again ."}
{"text":"After a terrible morning on a rainy day, I sort of lost my cool in this store and stormed out without my food. I sat in my car fuming (over something stupid) and who I suspect to be the supervisor walked out and brought me my food, and had such a look of care and compassion in her eyes that it made me feel bad for being an idiot. It was a small gesture but meant so much. Thank you."}
{"text":"I love the All American burger chain. They have grass fed all natural Beef burgers. Love the coffee # mccafe. \nLove the Fries"}
{"text":"Yes it is a McDonalds but this location stands out as always having friendly attentive service and consistently gets your orders right. The menu is what is it, but if you choose to order from it the service here is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Located conveniently right off 422's 306 exit (despite three traffic lights and turning left against busy traffic!)  Food and service have generally been up to McDonald's standards - no problem there.  Due to its convenient location, the drive-thru can get pretty well backed up throughout the day."}
{"text":"This is the best mcdonalds. My food is always hot and the employees are so nice and always smiling.Kinda reminds me of a commercial."}
{"text":"Ah the days of unemployment....more like the years of it...but there was a time when I struggled for a long time trying to find a job...my friend Carol use to help me out in many ways and since she worked for McDonalds, I'd be lucky enough to get a gift card while she was handing them out like candy...it was funny to see people...grown adults light up when she gave out \"free food\" so-to-speak.\n\nSo it is my birthday this week and as I usually do, I eat and drink whatever I want.  So today it was lunch at McDonalds....and my little way of saying thanks to Carol by helping her retirement *wink*.\n\nSeriously, where I grew up we had only 1 McDonalds for years and years....the building was ol' school...with the two big arches on each side of the building....I grew up on big macs and fries....so I thought it only fitting to have that again......I super sized it of course and ate at the McDonalds that is located in BB&T building in downtown Charlotte.\n\nThe service....as always was quick....the food...as always was hot....and the taste was a little bit of my childhood back to say hello.....man I love this food."}
{"text":"McDonalds...yes, your marketing worked on me. Here I am instead of at Libretto's Pizzeria (which to me is the McDonald's of pizza, nothing great...but consistent).  I came here to try your sirloin burger. \n\nAtmosphere - slightly updated but did not appear like the McCafe style that seems to be popping up all over. \n\nService - Order Counter line is awkward as no one knows where to stand after ordering. Busy, polite and friendly employees (I was called \"sweetie\"), fast service. \n\nFood - I came here because of the marketing. I came here for a sirloin burger which looked pretty good on TV.  At over 700 calories, I opted to remove things I don't care for (mayo) and things I know based on the source are not worth the calories (cheese).  Upon opening the container of my Lettuce and Tomato sirloin burger variant of the three offerings, I noticed that there was a mixup on the bread as they gave me a pretzel-esq bun instead of the advertised sesame. Everything else was correct (including the box) so I was not too bothered. The burger was hot and juicy. I really liked the pickle, red onion, green leaf lettuce, and bright red tomato with a splash of mustard. The only thing I could do without was the heavy amount of salt.   Which having stayed away from a McDonalds for quit a while made the excess sodium very noticeable.  Overall, I was pleased. \n\nSince I didn't get fries (I know...a sin), I got a basic hamburger just to drown with ketchup and mustard and relive my youth.  It brought back memories and amazement that you can get a burger for .89!\n\nOverall - While the sirloin burger did convert me back to Mikey D's as a regular (Chick-fil-a), it has me realizing that every once in a while is not a bad thing."}
{"text":"Ever since I was a kid I've always loved McDonalds. I can't really put my finger on it but I'm sure it has something to do with Ronald McDonald and the happy meals. I'm not going to review the food at this location, because lets just face it we all know what McDonalds taste like. What I will review is the service, location and general overview of the restaurant. \n\nService: These cashiers are hard workers you will see the same smiling face day after day when you come by and order your usual and trust me there are \"regulars\" at this location. Often times I'll be waiting for my order and someone will step up to the line and even before they open their mouth the cashier will say #5 with large sweet tea. The customer will simply nod their head. These cashiers know their customers. The managers here are also  very pleasant. This McDonalds has less of a turnover rate then some of the companies I know. I only have one cashier I try to avoid because she just always seems to have a bad attitude. \n\n\nLocation: Overstreet Mall, Uptown Charlotte.  This is one of the busiest lunch areas in Charlotte. From about 11:45-1:30pm you have thousands of people walk-running like herds of cattle through over street. When I say walk-run it's really just that! They don't walk and they don't run it's like a very fast pace walk, which almost feels like if you get in the way they are going to run you over. It takes some time to get used to once you start working uptown. Oh and heaven forbid you're a slow walker... you'll get some pretty mean stares to the back of your head.\n\nGeneral Overview: They actually just remodeled this location last year so it looks so much better. It's much cleaner and the seating is a lot nicer. At other McDonalds you don't have to wait very long before getting your food and at this one it's about the same, but because of the mass amount of food they have to push out they have a system. There are two separate lines. You have a line to order your food and then a separate line to pick up your order. Try not to get confused because it can be very confusing to newbies and throws us regulars off."}
{"text":"This McDonald's location is definitely one of my favorites.  Since I no longer work Uptown, I always stop in here after a doctor's appointment.  After fasting all night and into the morning, I am prime for some hot coffee and a great sandwich (sausage, egg & cheese mcmuffin)!  Service is always excellent and the store typically has a pretty good rating.  I understand (at least previously) staff members received a bonus every time they etched out a 100 or better.  That shows pride in your work.  \n\nNOTE:  This location is open until 7 pm on Fridays."}
{"text":"The people that work here are too stupid to work anywhere, and they want $15 a hour? Are you frigging kidding me? My husband goes just about every morning to get me breakfast , and if he goes 7 times, 4 out of the 7 , the order is always wrong. He went this morning and of course when he got back it was wrong. We called them and this gal that took the order and answered the phone got a smart ass attitude at me, then Ed got the phone and she got even smarter with him, telling him to complain about it , she don't care ,of course she don't care she standing there making her little money for doing shit. I am sorry but this is not acceptable , if you can't work with the public then either stay your ass at home , or stay in school so you can learn to do something else because you sure as hell don't know what the hell you are doing there!! This one didn't deserve $4 a hour must less $15 .Yes I called the corporate office and yes I am also putting this on yelp and face book. So my advise to you is if you want something from McDonald do not go to this one ."}
{"text":"This is the McDonald's inside the Walmart....honestly I do t have any complaints about this location.  It's fast and efficient and I can get some quick fries for my daughter which keeps her occupied while we go shopping.  \n\n\n\nAt times it can seem a little ghetto but you have to take the location in consideration.  Staff is always friendly and it appears to be clean all the time I go in there.  No complaints from me.  I just get my meal and keep it moving"}
{"text":"This update has been way over due.\n\nBut they have made several changes to their staff and thank God. It makes a world of a difference when you have customer service oriented employees. \n\nSome days it is still crowded and the service should be a little faster. It is FAST food. However, there have been several improvements and we have little to no problems now."}
{"text":"This place is quite sub par, even for a McDonald's.  This place is really ghetto, and there's always a bunch of annoying kids loitering and taking up the available tables.  I guess it's OK if you want to grab a soda on a hot day or a snack to munch on while walking around, but again, it's not very good... for your health or for taste.  I say, exert some self-discipline, buy something worthwhile in Walmart's grocery section, then go home and prepare something worth eating."}
{"text":"McDonald's has their fast-food formula down pat and this location is no exception.  I do appreciate that on the rare occasion I find myself in this location, everything is clean.... the employees are nice and the food is.... what is expected.\n\nI have noticed on my drives to the office that the drive-thru is usually very busyand non stop.... even at 6:30 in the morning.  I guess it's easier to stop at the golden arches on the way to work to get your caffeine fix.  I spend so much time in my car as is so a 30 second walk to the building is my preferred choice if I am going to take out.  It is pretty satisfying to see people still in line to put their order in the drive thru when I can breeze in, get my food, and drive away..."}
{"text":"This is the worst McDonald's ever! I will never visit this location again, although I live less than 2 miles away. I have been here several times to mediocre service and food, always hoping that they would get better. The last visit they were under construction and I walked in to see employees just sitting around in the dining area laughing and joking. When I got to the counter no one seemed to want to give me service. Finally one girl walks up to the counter and proceeds to take my order with no smile. I drive off eating barely warm fries and the driest burger on stale bread. I ended up just throwing it away. Did not have time to turn around and complain. Don't go to this location. The one on Indian Trail and Independence is 30 times better. This location is just awful. No wonder there are so many people over at Highway 55."}
{"text":"Dined in for the first time in a very long time. Food was even more mediocre than I remembered. To make it extra-special, they have the same song on a loop and it plays over and over and over.  Better than the constant alarm of food buzzers being ignored I suppose. I think I scratched that itch for years if not forever with this visit.  The calories are better spent elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Very much a typical McDs. My main concern was a real problem with flies inside and out. Makes me wonder how clean this place really is. Does Gordon Ramsay do chains?"}
{"text":"Different pricing than other McDonald's, coffee isn't $1 here. And add the cold burrito they served me without a smile, and it makes for an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Multiple issues with this location. For the past year, I have been visiting this location every morning on weekdays and some evenings. It is the only drive thru on my way to/from work and that is why I have put up with poor service for so long. They have now finished construction and hired friendlier staff; however, they have botched my order for the last time."}
{"text":"For the parents out there looking for a McDonald's on 485 with a playground. This one has a small one.  Otherwise a typical McDs."}
{"text":"8:00 and they are not open? Workers inside walking around but doors are locked, no explanation. Health Deptartment rating 91% (from earlier visit). Probably need to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food 2 stars. Positive attitude and service of regular drive thru guys..10 stars. The whole community loves them. Can't beat those $1 large drinks either!"}
{"text":"It's McDonalds so your looking @ a 3 star cap regardless.  Grabbed breakfast this morning & they botched my drive thru order.  Have been here in past with no issues though.  Drive thru service is key part of the \"fast\" food experience."}
{"text":"Ok, I understand it's McDonald's, what can we expect, right? Wrong.\n\nThis particular McDonad's fails time and time again, to the point where I would wait to get to either Robinson or across the bridge in Ben Avon to get my food. Constantly serving McDoubles that are messy, missing condiments (ketchup,pickles, S&P, etc), not filling your drink cup anywhere near full, fries are always cold and over salted. \n\nBut, customer service as far as drive thru is concerned, is excellent and cheerful. But, I get the feeling that they keep the \"crappy\" food just for drive-thru so people won't complain. \n\nThe last time I went, I went inside to sit down and eat with a friend. We both ordered the same thing, 2 McDoubles with small fries. Her first burger was an entirely plain burger - no cheese, toppings, or condiments. She was graciously given a replacement. My second burger - lacked every topping and condiment but had cheese. I didn't feel the need to complain because I did not want to waste the current burger to eat my replacement or vice versa. \n\n\nAnd, I hate going inside McDonald's restaurants to eat and the last time I did, solidified my disgust. I do not need the doors to the play area open to hear seven children under the age of 10 running and screaming. Close the doors, lets be serious.\n\n\nI know, get over myself, it's McDonald's. But, you expect to get what you spend your hard earned money on, right? And, since you can't complain online - here's my review/complaint.\n\n-Enjoy."}
{"text":"This McDonalds is disgusting! Needs a complete remodel and some employees that actually clean it!"}
{"text":"Old, out of date, needs remodel badly. Floor was filthy. Bathroom just as bad. Napkin holder empty. Trash in the tray below the drink/ice machine. Will not visit this location again."}
{"text":"Can you give less than 1-star?  I have been to many McDonalds throughout the country.  This is the worse one by far.  It is always dirty and poorly maintained.  I have yet to have my order correct on first try.  The milkshake machine is operational only 25% of the time.  The staff is constantly being replaced (sign of poor management).  I like McDonald,s so this not a fast food snob review.  Do yourself a favor drive down University and goto the Cori McDonalds.  That one is always clean and great service."}
{"text":"Craving fries and a coke. Took me 20 minutes to get through the drive thru. There was only 4 people in front of me. I had to pull up and wait for my drink. Then they forgot about me. I had to go inside and ask for it. What the hell. That's what I get for cheating on my diet."}
{"text":"I would give one star but out of my last three visits this month, I had one good visit. My first visit, some hobo had a long conversation with me in the dining room about how he helps out the store by changing their trash and other things, which I'm sure is illegal, that visit my food was fresh though, which makes it worth it for me. Second visit the lady up front had her back to the counter while she was stocking which is fine, but the thing was she noticed I was there and NEVER acknowledged me. Another worker came up and asked her if she took my order than she turned around and looked at me than turned back around and took a drive thru order on her headset. I get people worry about their timers cause sometimes the management get upset if they're bad timers but dang, she totally neglected the front counter. Then I overheard them talking to a customer on drive thru about how they weren't accepting credit cards that night so I just walked out. I believe in second chances though so I came back a few weeks later and got perfect service from one of the night time managers, she was really tall and African American but I don't remember seeing her name, very nice lady. Food was again fresh, which was perfect. She made up for those first two times I ever visited this store."}
{"text":"Worst McDonalds ever, ordered 4 mcchickins and 4 mcdoubles and a halfcut sweet tea with no ice. I got sweet tea with ice and only 3 mc chickens and 3 mcdoubles. And when we called back they said sorry an hung up"}
{"text":"Worst McD's in the entire state of Ohio. Never go here unless you want your order fucked up. Don't they have idiot proof ordering systems in there? I see them beeping and whirring away. Yet any time you come here, you don't get the right food. I should know better. Check the bag. There you go McDonald's, a new slogan for ya. CHECK THE BAG, BITCH. It's my fault for coming here. Oy vey, what a festering shithole of incompetence. I hope none of these people reproduce."}
{"text":"It'a mcdonalds of course it's good. I give it a 3 to let people know that their drive-thru is the slowest I have ever been through.  time I go there. I hate it makes me so mad. They aren't even an option anymore because they are so slow. Tbell and rally's are super fast and good enough. Pick up the speed!!"}
{"text":"Sat in the drive thru forever with no service. Even as cars lined up behind me the girl was only taking orders from the other lane. I finally gave up after the 3rd time she took the other lanes order over mine. This is by far the worst McDonald's in Cleveland if not the entire state"}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the slowest McDonald's I've ever been to.  There's two drive thru lanes, but all this does it confuse the workers.  I've placed orders and by the time I reach the cashier she's forgotten it and I am often asked \"Which order was yours?\".  A few months ago I pulled in around 8am on a Sunday.  I was the only car in the drive thru but no one would answer the speaker.  Finally I drove around and went in to order.  I saw all of the employees standing in the back laughing and joking, no one was up at the counter.  When the counter employee finally saw me, she gave a huge sigh and acted like I was bothering her by being there.\n\nI have occasionally gone there around 4-5am and am not surprised to be waiting up to ten minutes for food.  No, that's not an exaggeration, I timed it at a few seconds over 10 minutes last trip (with only two cars ahead of me).  I know it's a McD's and I'm not expecting a five star dining experience but the wait times can get ridiculous.\n\nAs far as the food goes, I haven't had an awful experiences.  They usually get my order right and the food is what you'd expect at a McD's, you're just going to wait an awful long time for it."}
{"text":"I needed some food fast - and so opted for fast food!\n\nOrdered a Filet O' Fish sandwich and a bottle of water.\n\nSandwich was made to order - hot and delicious! The cheese was melted just right, the tartar sauce was perfect, and the bun was soft and fresh.\n\nHit the spot!"}
{"text":"Worst mcdonalds store. All employees are not happy, not enthusiastic to work. The cashier was not even smiling. They should should just call in sick if they are not happy to work."}
{"text":"I know this is mcdonalds, but I've been going to this one for 20 years and it is still by far the slowest service of any.  Late at night I think they only have one girl doing everything, taking the orders, collecting the money, cooking the food, and handing it out the window.  This is probably a management and staffing problem.  I go next door to rallys and I'm in and out in no time, and they are very friendly at rally's.  It's hit or miss at this mcdonalds."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes for a mocha frappe. Nobody came to talk to me about what exactly it was I was waiting for or apologize for the wait. He handed me the drink and I asked \"what was the wait for?\" He slammed the window in my face and ignored me. I beeped my horn and he continued to look up at the screen and ignore me. I would've sat and waited for him to have to acknowledge me, but I was late picking my son up from school. I drive by every day. I will never stop again. I also tried to call - no answer (surprise, right?). And these people want $15 an hour?"}
{"text":"Westlake 2 McDonald's you've done it again! Your cashier told me this location doesn't serve all day breakfast when the location done the street confirmed you do!!!\n\nTo anyone reading this review both McDonald's in Westlake are corporate stores meaning they are not owned or operated by a franchisee."}
{"text":"Why the hell would they plan on sealing their parking lot in the middle of the day during lunch hour! Piss poor planning."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed this morning. Asked for two steak and egg burritos (had been 2 @$3). They originally charged $3.38. I asked if the special was still good and she came back and said yes. So, drive to window, given my order and drive off. Get to my destination in lakewood and open the bag. The two burittos are literally half the size they usually are!  What a joke. And they had obviously made them while i waited at the window for the girl to check the price-there was no timestamp sticker. A bit unethical if you ask me."}
{"text":"Poor service, cold sandwich, hard bread, dirty store, wallpaper falling off the wall. Don't waste your time at this one."}
{"text":"This is the worst McDonalds in the world. I've eaten at a lot of McDonalds in a lot of locations this is absolutely the sorriest mistake McDonalds ever did by giving these people a franchise. McDonalds get smart and take back your franchise and give it to an American."}
{"text":"Went thru the drive-thru at approx. 1040P.M. Eager to try the buttermilk chicken sandwich. $4.59 got me a old dry chicken filet. old hard bun, 1 piece of extremely thin wilted lettuce, and all workers were extremely friendly as they were knowingly ripping me off. You guys and your clown will never top Wendys or Arbys for a quality chicken sandwich product. I would be more understanding if I was charged the more appropriate $1,00 Mcchicken price, O, and no receipt was given to me. I had to hurry to work. Never again!"}
{"text":"New Years Day, stopped for a quick bite to eat at 11:30 am. Quick? Not so much. The drive-thru line was busy, maybe 8 cars. I dined in, and that line had about 2 or 3 couples ahead of me plus at least that many waiting for their food after ordering. One unenthusiastic young lady working the register. A whole bunch of workers running around that didn't accomplish much but burned a lot of energy doing it, and all of them were churlish to customers. Took about 10 minutes waiting to order and 10 more to get the food. One ice machine was empty, there was some metal thing sitting askew under the beverage spigots, which made it tough to get a drink. No salt, pepper, etc., just napkins and straws. The french fries had zero salt, so salt shakers or packets would have been nice. I am not from the area, but I wouldn't return anyway if I were."}
{"text":"I drive up and down 90 and have eaten at every McD and this is the worst over all.  Service is always slower than normal, today's visit I was only customer and they couldn't get the order right.   I love McD but not this one"}
{"text":"This is the worst location ever! I refuse to go to this location. In all the years that I went, I never had an order that was correct.  The staff was rude, and one time when I stopped, one employee had her child there just running wild behind the counter"}
{"text":"The single, worst McDonald's franchise I've ever seen.  It is consistently 10+ minutes to get in & out.  There is always chaos behind the counter -- orders are wrong, the line moves VERY slowly, and the whole process frequently grinds to a halt.  Great location, but just the worst efficiency I've ever seen in a McDonald's.  And, it's been this bad for YEARS."}
{"text":"Newly renovated and this place is 5 stories tall! This place was clean and was open 24 hrs. The touch screen ordering was quick and simple and so much easier since I knew exactly what I was putting on my bill. Service was moderate and consistent with better american McDonalds. Good coffee and oatmeal."}
{"text":"Terrible service. \n\nThe service was too slow. They need more checkouts open during peak times"}
{"text":"Mcdonald's is Mcdonald's, not much else to say other than I like the \"new\" renovations. Makes the place look more cozy. When you go at night (from 11pm and on), they become unstaffed and service is really slow!"}
{"text":"Love the new decor, however the service are slower than other McDonald's I've been to..."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst McDonald's location I've ever been to in my life. Literally INFESTED with homeless. Stay away."}
{"text":"It is the last choice I have ever think about it ( before King burger) if you are in montreal down town and you feel hungry you can find a 5-dollar burger panini ( Joes panini , 1401 Rue Drummond ). It is wasting money. I only like Mac cafe and ice creams. The quality is really good."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Super slow. Unfriendly staff. Dirty location. Super narrow. Shady characters. Stay away from this place. They only have one counter to order the rest is all self serve booths. The line ups are crazy during lunch times. NOT RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"McCuse me, this was a joke, cold food, no smiles and it took 15 minutes to get your cold food, should have stopped at Denny's in Madison.  Fricken speakers in the bathroom were distorting the music like a 1920's phonograph.  FIx the leaky toilet friend.  One person cooking breakfasts in the the back is not cutting it when you have 12 people out in front trying to trying to figure out 'What Happened' Jesus, I hope intestines make it through this."}
{"text":"This McDonaldl's is right off I-94 at Exit 126 in DeForest.  It's a new building with new bathrooms.  The bathroom decor is nice, but on the day I came through here, it was not clean. Service was good, and the food was standard McDonald's fare. There's a convenient but slightly pricey BP next door. I've decided that this is not the best stretch along 94 for McDonald's.  They're nicer in the Dells, but gas will be more expensive too."}
{"text":"Since so many of the changes, the service is slow, like it is at all the other McDonald's everywhere, but the people that work here are very nice.  Also, the location is convenient because it's right off the freeway with easy on/off access.  They are willing to make substitutions, and they have even given recommendations.  Their morning crew is especially friendly.  At times, it's interesting because this location runs out of things more than other places I have been to.  I'm not sure why that is.  The other day, they were out of Diet Coke, but they were very polite and apologetic about it and offered Coke Zero, which is fine by me.  Also, their ice cream machine will go on streaks where it breaks down a lot. I know this because I have family members that love, love, love the McFlurries.  If you need a place to eat that's right off the freeway, feel free to check them out."}
{"text":"Generally I don't review fast food places unless the customer service is outstanding or severely lacking. Unfortunately this review falls in the latter category. First the positive. This location is easy to access from the street, has sufficient parking, and the interior was clean although I did not see what state the bathrooms were in. My food was ready quickly and the employee who was calling out order numbers was friendly and ensured I received everything I ordered.\n\nAs for the customer service, my order was taken by a clearly inexperienced manager who walked away from the register no less than 4 times after asking \"What can I get for you?\" but before I could get a word out. When I finally had her attention again, I ordered my meal and took my receipt and she walked away again before giving me a cup for my drink. I was not impressed with the owners choice in management.\n\nThis location does not have a play area aside from a couple electronic games on the wall. Despite the distracted manager, the food was not below par for what it is and there were no safety or health concerns so I think 3 stars is fair for this visit."}
{"text":"This has got to be the slowest fast food drive up. 10 mins in line. Ice cream Sunday was partially melted. Took forever to get just one fish fillet even after waiting forever in line."}
{"text":"Worst location ever!!!!\n\n\n\nDont waste ur time here ...especially on Sundays!!!!\n\n\n\nWorst management ever\n\nOwned by a group based outta BOSTON\n\n\nScrew this location.\n\n\nDrive 4 miles outta ur way...still will get service faster"}
{"text":"The coke still has a funny taste. I was hoping after they remodeled that that would be fixed."}
{"text":"I have visited this location on many occasions and have been disappointed one too many times. I'd say that going through the drive-thru has caused me more misery than necessary. I'm sure they've gotten my order wrong a minimum of 75% of the time and today's order included pickle stacked on the top (meaning outside) of the sandwich. Also, while waiting at the drive-thru window one time I even had the employee chat me up a bit during a long wait for food. He had the nerve to complain that McDonald's required that he take a test and that he failed it. (Shocking!) Do yourself a favor and avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"06/04/13\n\nIt's McDonalds,not much to say. I just wanted to point out the cool interior."}
{"text":"17 minutes in the drive thru. 12 of those minutes after I  paid. I ordered a sausage biscuit and a soda at 11:27am. If you can't be prepared for all day breakfast, don't offer it."}
{"text":"Fast food must not be fast anymore...?\n\nAfter a 15 minute drive through wait, I drove up, smiled and said hello. I received a curt glance and a price for my food. \n\nI said thank you when I received my food, and the chick turned around and walked away.  \n\nThanks for reminding me why I haven't gone to McDonald's in years."}
{"text":"Really need to stop coming here, they take forever to even acknowledge you, then spend forever taking care of drive. I know they are probably timed but just because I am inside doesn't mean I have time to wait forever. Most McDonald's I'm in and out five minutes tops, this one I wait five minutes to even get acknowledged, let alone the 10 plus minutes I have to wait for simple chicken nuggets."}
{"text":"Terrible service... with 6 people in line, you'd think that they would have more than 1 reg open. The manager refused to acknowledge any sense of urgency. After waiting for 10 minutes for them to take the order of 1 person, I walked out. Save yourself the headache. Do not visit this location."}
{"text":"I have been giving this location opportunity after opportunity to continue giving it my business as it is close to my house and i like stopping before work.   But after the last screw up of many i have decide i will not ever go back to this location. . I can't even recall all the things i could say here as there are so many to try n remember.  But I'll just say that I've been late to work 2 or 3 times due to getting stuck in the drive through and the exceptionally slow service of the crew.  My order has been wrong on several occasions and i was already on the highway and running late so i couldn't go back.  I've got tea that was supposed to be raspberry come out just regular sweet tea, muffins with out egg, . But most frustrating is the day i asked for a large tea with my double Filet o fish meal and just medium fry. I got a small drink and giant fry and regular filet. when i told the girl at the window what i ordered she asked for my receipt to make sure I knew what i was taking about, inconveniencing me after I had been in the drive thru for almost 20 minutes instead of just giving me what i asked for.  I will say i got pretty upset with her and she handled it well and kept her composure. For cussing and raising my voice i am sorry to her .  However its extremly frustrating being made late for work and then to get the wrong order to boot and being the 3rd or 4th time this has happened, i had it!!  But ill mention There is a African American guy that works the morning window who is really nice and does a good job and he shouldn't be included in the grouping of the slow lacking crew . ."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm reviewing a McDonald's - but it had to happen.  Not just because I'm a freaking fast food junkie so it was going to happen one of these days anyhow - but because of today's experience.\n\nI've been to this one, well, let's just say more than several times.  The food is always.... uneventful.  It's not one of those specifically great or specifically bad ones.  It's just..... fine?  The only really good thing I got there once was their big breakfast.  It was only McDonald's good, but man it tasted good that day.\n\nAnyhow, so I was grabbing a breakfast burrito (that stupid healthy yogurt was not going to calm the grumbling monster that was my tummy that morning).  For breakfast, I'll normally either get my item solo, or as the meal w/ OJ.  But I remembered seeing last week that in a blind taste test, the McDonald's coffee actually scored higher on a taste test than Starbucks.  So I figured I'd give it a shot.  \n\nACKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!  PLECCCHHHHH!!!  Ick!  Ug!  Gross!  Spit, spit, spit....   I wanted to wipe my tongue down w/ the wood tasting napkin to scrape it all off.  \n\nThey had thrown in some sugar and cream.  I'll normally do a cream and a sugar for one this sized.  I initially tried it black. I thought maybe it was better w/ the stuff added.  This was a SMALL cup, and I added both creamers and all 6 sugars they gave me and I could barely taste any sweetness.  It was like the black hole of coffee condiments.  What is totally sad - I ended up drinking about 1/2-3/4 the cup just trying it after adding each condiment.  I really wanted it to be better.  Kept waiting for that magic ingredient.  It didn't come.  \n\nNasty, nasty, nasty.  Mediocre fast food, fine.  But the extra 15 min drive to Starbucks suddenly looks much more reasonable."}
{"text":"Normally I try to stay away from McDonalds because they are everywhere so they are where I go when there is nothing else.  I still end up eating there every year or so with travel.  This time though I was just tired and it was the closest place to eat.\n\nI went through the drive through and got one of the chicken wraps with fries and a drink.  When I got my bag there was no ketchup!  They didn't even ask if I wanted any.  Despite no ketchup the french fries tasted better than the wrap thing I had.\n\nI don't normally eat here so I can't comment if the blah taste of my food was typical or not, but it wasn't worth the calories.  Plus I was peeved to be without ketchup."}
{"text":"If I could give this location zero stars, that would be more accurate.  Poor customer service, they are constantly taking down the ice cream and shake machines several hours before they close and just say that they don't have ice cream products because they are cleaning the machine.  Well this is supposed to be done at closing time, not at 9pm, people in Az eat ice cream all hours of the day and night. I'm sure the owner would love to know about all the money he is loosing because these employees don't want to wait until closing time."}
{"text":"I didn't try the coffee. I had nuggets and a double and it was alright. Still looking for mc d's that likes to give extra nuggets."}
{"text":"ya bro dis shit sux"}
{"text":"I'm not expecting too much. It's McDonald's, but you should take the orders correctly. Customers won't come back if they pay for 2 Big Mac but only get one. Hire more people if you are busy."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere here.\nFun fact: glass for water is 11 cents here. WOW. This is the first time I am asked to pay for water anywhere in the US. \nOtherwise, this is a good place to stay overnight studying. The place is bright enough and there are several table near a charging port.\n\nI just tried their new mcflurry and I liked it. I believe this place is open 24 hours and they have been trying to improve their service lately ."}
{"text":"I had the number one. It took as long as it normally does for a human being to assemble a Big Mac, put some fries in a container and place it on a tray. The coke from the fountain was fine.\nAfter I finished the meal,\nI went back to the counter and ordered a \"mcflurry\" which was pretty good as well.\nThank goodness for McDonalds. This is why America is awesome.\nI even used the restroom, which was relatively clean, considering how crowded the place was on a Monday at 2:30 in the afternoon."}
{"text":"It's not much different from most other McDonald's. Even if they are really busy, I still get my food fast and accurate. Customer service is average."}
{"text":"ok so we all know that mcdonalds is awesome. there's nothing i can complain about. EXCEPT that here, they tell you they gave you a straw in your bag but you look in it after you drive away and it's not there. Liars!"}
{"text":"It's McDonald's. Enough said. Service can range time to time, but that's expected with fast food. Always make sure you have everything in your bag after ordering, and just go back and ask if not - no big deal. I would recommend the dollar menu, as you can get a McChicken, McDouble, large fries, and a large drink for only $5 total.\n\nHere's a tip - If you order any sized value meal, you can upgrade your drink to a large free of charge because all drinks are $1!!!"}
{"text":"How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways.\nSeriously. I hate this McDonalds.\nI'm obsessed with McDonald's breakfast and I'm a fatty so I come here every morning before class. Out of the million times I've come here, I've gotten the right order THREE TIMES. I'm not exaggerating. I'm DEAD serious.\nI know it seems confusing why I would continue to come here after all those mess ups but I had no choice since I'm addicted to their breakfast and it's the closest to my classes.\nIdk if there's an issue with management or with the workers but they need to shape up."}
{"text":"The worst quality McDonald I have been to. My McChicken only comes with one slice of bun.........\nThe other side is missing. The server gave us the wrong nugget sauce and forgot to put our fries in the bag. Terrible service and  management."}
{"text":"They advertise specials...then don't train their crew on how to ring you up...so they charge you full price and you don't notice till after you've left.  Employees just standing around and chatting while i wait 13 minutes for a coffee and a sausage biscuit.  Seriously...how do these stores stay in business??  I'm losing faith in the local owner operator everytime I walk through the doors here...."}
{"text":"On my first visit to this store, I had a bad experience because of an employee who was rude to me.  They have an arcane policy that if you happen to have a water bottle with you, you are not allowed to have it in the store at all.  Instead of showing any appreciation for my patronage, she scolded me in front of three other front counter employees and several customers, at full volume, and I will remember how that made me feel.\n\nI called the 800 number for corporate and they understood the concern, will review the complaint according to company policy, and assured me that they appreciate their customers.  They did everything they could to make the situation better.  Even though I pass this McDonald's often, I am unsure if I will return to this particular store ever again.  There is a Subway half a block away and I think they will get most of my fast food business from now on."}
{"text":"The service is horrendous. Went there numerous times and my orders have been messed up."}
{"text":"Not enough people working. Flies inside muffin/cookie case. Dirty tables. Person taking my order seemed confused yet was in a managers uniform, awkwardly repeating, almost questioning everything that was ordered. Order number was loudly repeated several times despite coming right to counter. Ordered 2 Happy Meals w/ bbq. Didn't get any. Daughter went up to get some and was told it was .50 each. I went up and told them that it wasn't put into the Happy Meals and was asked \"It wasn't?!\" As I got back to my table, I noticed one of the BBQ pkts was open/leaking. Sat down and opened apple slices from the Happy Meal. Noticed they looked a bit off color. They had expired Aug. 30. The date I visited was Sept. 7. I took both the BBQ and the apples up to the counter and handed them to a \"manager\" (?). He got me another BBQ and had to go to the back to find fresh apple slices. He handed them to me with a \"Here ya go.\" No apology. Won't return to this McDonalds again."}
{"text":"I know no one reviews McDonalds, but this drive through is seriously awesome. It has two lanes... and back home, only bums go to Mcdonalds...  but this mcdonald's poppin'!! It's where all the cool kids hang out, and I have no problems giving in to this guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"McDonalds is generally McDonalds.  The food here is fine, but service/atmosphere is lacking.  They seem to have some sketchy clientele (almost saw a fight break out here once).  Also, they have very strict BBQ sauce quotas. Unless you buy mcnuggets or chicken selects, they make you pay for any bbq sauce you want ($0.25/pack); I think it's sort of ridiculous  that you can't get free bbq sauce with your chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"This isn't a bad spot. We just came in here for a quick bite. There's a drive through, ample parking and it's pretty clean in with a lot of seating and TVs. Looks like McDonalds decided to be classy. \n\nThe food took a little longer than usual to arrive, but service was good and the food is exactly what you'd expect. There's a self-serve drink station which I immediately used to make my own pop concoction. Then had refills before I left, which was pretty sweet."}
{"text":"Free wi-fi & need huge space then get here :)"}
{"text":"Managers good and Customer friendly but wait time OmG.. Could do better at hustling to get orders out. Place is usually clean and organized. Smile is missing on faces but understandably due to long shifts. Overall not the best Mc D I have been but satisfactory."}
{"text":"The children's play area is pretty decent. I like it because it's not just a slide and plastic boxes. It's actually a sports-inspired play area. It's an asset for McD to have this type of place inside the restaurant while parents enjoy their happy meal, I mean, \"their combo meal\". =)"}
{"text":"Das etwas andere Fr√ºhst√ºck. ...\nHaben mal Fr√ºhst√ºck bei Mc Donalds ausprobiert. \nHat uns gut gefallen,  unsere Bestellung wurde frisch zubereitet. Das was etwas l√§nger dauerte hat sie uns an den Tisch gebracht. Mitarbeiterin war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Preis - Leistung passt.\nToiletten waren sauber. Das einzige was nicht sauber war , war  die Abtrennung zwischen den einzelnen Bereichen,  leider schon l√§nger nicht sauber gemacht."}
{"text":"Nun ist es also seit ein paar Monaten wieder offen dieses aussergew√∂hnliche Restaurant von Mc Donalds. Der Umbau zum Mc Cafe hat sich gelohnt, da man echt angenehm sitzt in den neuen R√§umlichkeiten.\n\n\n Hier werden wie in der Filiale im Sterncenter auch toll gestapelte Burger serviert. Meine Ausf√ºhrungen zu den Problemen mit den sonst mir bekannten Draufklatschtechniken habe ich bei dem anderen bereits erw√§hnt.\n\n\n Und auch hier ist alles rundrum gut. Freundliches Personal - egal zu welcher Uhrzeit, frisch zubereitete Burger in akzeptabler Zeit, saubere WC's und Tische (ohne dass die Reinigungskr√§fte das Putzmittel w√§hrend des ersten Bissens derart verspr√ºhen, dass pl√∂tzlich Shake, Pommes und Burger nach den gleichen Reinigungsnebeln schmecken!), entspannte Stimmung und hier eben noch die tats√§chlich guten Kaffeeangebote.\n\n\n Neben dem gar nicht weit entfernten Mc Donalds im Sterncenter habe ich im Umkreis von Stuttgart kein anderes Restaurant der ganz deutschland √ºberschwemmenden Kette gefunden in dem ich mit so viel Appetit und Zufriedenheit meinen Burger verspeisen konnte.\n\n\n Der ebenfalls in diesem Multifunktionsrestaurant enthaltene Mc Drive iat ebenfalls zu empfehlen, da hier die Stop-And-Go Phasen deutlich k√ºrzer sind als anderswo."}

Pommes sind kalt und es fehlt im Mac Drive immer etwas, also gleich stehen bleiben und nochmals Kontrollieren. Hab mir schon zum dritten mal ein Mac Men√º bestellt und immer noch keine Tasse bekommen, also man bekommt die nur auf anfrage obwohl es automatisch laufen sollte. Habe noch nie so ein schlechten Mc Donals besucht wie der hier. aber eine Gute Nachricht gibt es  ein neuer Mc hat in B√∂blingen er√∂ffnet und der hat es etwas besser drauf  bis jetzt."}
{"text":"Unbegreiflich, ich dachte bei dieser Kette mu√ü ein Mindestma√ü an Qualit√§t und Service herrschen. Kontrolliert das denn keiner. Leute wie kann man auf den ganzen Linie so viel versauen. Service geht gar nicht. Freundlichkeit vergebens gesucht. Zubereitung .bitte wie Schaft man das. Ist doch eigentlich alles Konzept. Sogar das versaut das Team. Sauberkeit ist hier noch nicht Sortiment. Mensch Mc Donalds, haut da mal zwischen. Der Laden schadet den eh schon angeschlagenen Ruf von Fastfood."}

{"text":"Eher schlechte Leistung f√ºr einen Mc D. \nDas \"Restaurant\" ist neu und in Topzustand.\nLeider kann das Personal nicht mithalten.\nDer Burger war nicht so zusammengestellt wie er sein sollte - es fehlten Zutaten - meine Fritten waren gerade aus uns sollten gebracht werden - das wurde aber vergessen und erforderte eine Reklamation - als Entschuldigung eine Apfeltasche."}

{"text":"It's McDonald's.  What do you expect.  Except here they have never gotten my order right. Never. Not a single time.  They'd rather chat"}
{"text":"I entered the drive thru and tried to place an order. Your menu is horribly congested. Instead of listing single items with different options, all the items and different combinations are listed everywhere, which makes it confusing to order when the lady on the intercom is pressuring you to order immediately or be ignored.\n\nWhen I got to the window to pay, the black lady at the first window took my card and swiped it and handed it back to me without so much as a second glance. I waited for some sort of acknowledgment of any kind that the transaction went through, and there was nothing. The lady stood there for about 30 seconds then after the car in front of me pulled forward she stuck her head out to look at the card behind me as if she was hoping they would run me over.\n\nI responded the way she should have and said thank you and pulled forward to the next window. I felt discriminated against. You already poison people with cholesterol and false advertising, I am amazed that I can't even get a smile and a thank you for your business when I go to eat your junk food.\n\nI can't even imagine what a horrible environment this company creates for their employees that they obviously don't want to work there, they aren't using their full creative potential, and they will probably take some sort of recourse against the employee when it is actually the entire establishment at fault. The treatment of people in this country disgusts me even more than they lard they use to grease the grill."}
{"text":"It's consistent with any other McDonald's...orders come out wrong about 1 out of 8 times I go.  May be the confusion dual drive thru line idea. Dual lines for ordering seem nice but they don't always take orders in the order you pull up...then it's an awkward fight pulling forward when the other car thought they were first to order but was not.  Kids area is nice."}

{"text":"Served food that was cold and had been sitting. When asked for then to please make my breakfast fresh the manager seemed disgusted and then it took almost ten minutes for them to bring out new food. But it seemed them just stuck old ones back in the microwave. Don't waste your money coming here. They give a bad name to McDonald's."}
{"text":"It's McDonald's so it's low expectations to begin with but this location is even more pathetic and below the already bad standards... The employees who work at night don't even speak or respond when taking an order or payment or wait to confirm if anything is accurate- which of course it never is.."}
{"text":"Dude. It's McDonalds. I don't know what exactly you're expecting.\n\nAlthough this location does now have the dual order windows and 24 hours drive through. No word on the late midnight breakfast though.\n\nWould've given this place four stars from over the years, but recently I've been getting sass from the drive through window late at night. Yes I understand it's tiring, but I never had to deal with attitude at Jack in the Box down the street."}
{"text":"I went at 12:49am on the night of Friday the 13th, 2016. We went to the drive thru and no one said anything for a whole minute so we just went up to the window. A guy named Frank opened the window and refused to service us even though all we wanted was ice waters. We're in Arizona and it's 100 degrees outside isn't it illegal to refuse water? Frank needs to get fired. If we had to buy something to get them we would have but he told us to drive around the drive thru all over again just because he never said anything at the intercom. How is that our fault? There was only 1 car  next to us in a double drive thru when we went. After we waited forever behind a car he told us to go around and wait in a now long line for just ice waters. I don't know what that guy's problem was, but customer service is definently not what Frank should be doing. In case there is more than one Frank at this location. This guy had some tats on his arm. I will never go back to this location, not as long as Frank works here."}
{"text":"I know it's McDonalds so I shouldn't expect much but this location was such a disappointment. \n\nShort and simple: I asked for large fries and got medium. Not that big of a deal because I looked at my receipt and only paid for medium so whatever. But I love ketchup. Seriously, I could swim in ketchup. She only gave me ONE ketchup packet for all those fries... So I asked if I could have a few more. She then gives me, again, only ONE more packet (and looked extremely annoyed while doing so). \n\nDirty woman's bathroom too. Not good customer service."}
{"text":"So this McDonald's is listed as having a 24 hour drive thru So I have tried to go the last few days, I work nights and have taken my lunch break around 3am-330am both night and have been told they they were closed for \"system changeover\" (or something like that) . Today I got there at 315 and was told it would be 45 minutes before they would serve food I accepted it and left. I came back at 410 (I waited a bit for safe measure) and was was told it would be 45-50 minutes before they started serving again because of system changeover. There was lots of noise in the background and I stated I was told that 45 minutes ago and she rudely replied sorry! If I could give less than 1 star I would!"}
{"text":"This McDonalds is very disorganized - like it's being run by monkeys. I go through the drive through regularly since it's on my way to work and they consistently get the order wrong or make me park and wait."}
{"text":"Colorful cashier in the morning you'll either like or be annoyed with unless you're like me and you're ambivalent.\n\nParking is tight but usually 1 space available during peak periods.\n\nWifi signal drops but not frequently, Signal strength is good and \n\nHas an electrical outlet for smart phone & laptops.\n\nChild's play area.\n\nBathrooms are okay."}

Every single time I have ever went there or even a friend or family member they have gotten our orders WRONG! My son is allergic to cheese you jackasses and he came close to eating one of your fucked up orders!!!! Come on you can't even get a kids meal right??? Your food is NEVER fresh, and when I ask for it to be made fresh you give me problems. Your machines are always broken! What a bunch of lazy, careless scum bags, hope you choke on a fry!"}
{"text":"Sausage McMuffin with egg sandwich and a small coffee with a cream and a sugar: $3:88\n\nWhy this Mickey D's?\n\nThey're fast. I'm entering the drive-thru at 7:15 and leaving it at 7:18. \n\nLocation. A stones throw from Raintree/101.\n\nConsistency. Each day my Sausage McMuff tastes just as good as the day before and the coffee gets me going in the morning.\n\nHealthy? Eh, sort of. You can get the sandwich and coffee for just shy of 500 calories. The fine print is that they make up for calories with fat and cholesterol. Though, you can substitute the eggs for egg whites. That way you pay the difference now (in cash), instead of when you're 60 (in bypass surgery)."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible! \n\nI went through drive-thru and ordered my food and all was well. I pulled up to the window and waited for at least 20 minutes for someone to come out. Time passed and no one even came by to at least make me pay. \n\nOut of frustration I drove off. Worst service ever and according to other reviews it may be the worst McDonald's location."}
{"text":"An employee from this mcdonalds stole my change.\n\nI go to this mcdonalds frequently, probably 4 times a week.  Yesterday I had work all day and then an event to go to and didn't come home till 3:30 in the morning.  I hadn't eaten since lunch and I was desperate to get food.  I pulled up to mcdonalds and there was no one in line. When I got to the ordering box she told me it was cash only and to hold on.  Then she left the speaker on while doing things in the kitchen and I waited another 3 minutes listening to kitchen sounds and her talking before she decided to take my order.  I ordered 3 small things totaling to 3 something dollars.  I pulled up to the window and handed her a $10 bill.  Then I waited again.... Another 15 minutes went by as I'm getting more and more exhausted by the minute just wanting to get my food and get home. She finally brought my food out and I drove away.  As I was driving away I realized she never brought me a receipt or my change.  I know it was only $6 and some change she was missing, but still.... The matter of fact is she didn't bring me my change!  Or a receipt!  I got home and called the McDonald's and a manager said she would count the drawers and call me back.  Never got a call back.\n\nI don't understand why I got such bad service here.  I think the employee pocketed my change because I never got a call back about the total of the drawers.\n\nFrom the start prior to my money being stolen, I was already receiving bad service.\n\nReally disappointed."}

The man walking around taking up trash for people was very nice and he kept the tables and floors pretty clean. The bathrooms were very dirty and smelled like they mopped with water that had urine mixed with it. My order was accurate, this place could perform better with more training. The location is very good, the company is missing out on more potential customers due to lack of staff training and effort"}
{"text":"They never have anything after 10pm. Either the coffee machine broke down they're out of coffee, or they're cleaning the smoothie machine, or the system is down or is going to take 7 min to brew a pot of coffee. Terrible service!!"}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's experience I've ever had. \nThe man at the first window repeated the order back and it was correct....\nThen a younger blonde girl at the 2nd window was horribly rude. I asked for just 2 packets of extra ketchup because we only had 1 packet. . (For our 3 sanwhices and large fries) \nShe said, \"Uhm well you already have some in your bag?\" We told her we only had one. She then said \"Well then, no.\" And then quickly closed the window and proceeded to ignore us.\n Then we get on the road and realize nearly every order was wrong. Seriously? \nShe should be fired....she also gave us no receipt so I couldn't even come back and get it fixed. Something needs to happen. She should be fired."}

Before writing this review I thought maybe I had crap service from the manager then while trying to fill my cup at the fountain station an employee shoved me to fill her drink because \"she is on a quick break\" because I am Mexican and everyone else is american and Asian. But after reading these reviews I'm convinced it's just a rude dirty McDonald's. I never thought I'd write a review for a McDonald's!"}

The crust was the same as on the apple pies. Only went there for a small cone, but tis the season, so I obliged and was happy with my fast food pie."}
{"text":"Love the location - handy.  But, this place is not run like other McDonalds. \n\n Not uncommon to get cold, limp fries, dirty tables.  Today was the worst.  Breakfast.  Ordered a mcmuffin and the kid entered \"sausage biscuit no sausage\" in to the register.  When I said something, he blew me off.  So I got a bun with cheese and egg, no ham.  No coffee was made.  I asked for cream.  I sat down a second time now with coffee - but of course, no cream.    Every person in the restaurant at that time was returning to the counter because orders were missing items or mixed up or made wrong.  Whoever owns this restaurant, needs to get a couple of experienced McDonald's managers and get it right.   Running a restaurant like that takes training and diligence and good managers.  I have never seen the same face twice in that restaurant."}

With 3 people ahead of me I typically will wait 10-12minutes in the drive thru only to get 8 out of 10 times egg white delights with unmelted cheese on top.  Same for the inside for some reason this place does not believe in melting the cheese.  The owner needs to try his or her service level out."}
{"text":"This is undoubtedly the worst mcdonalds I've ever been to. One person working at the counter and she was slow. When my order finally came out I asked for hot sauce and they never brought it out. It's nice that they bring the food to your table however with no follow up on requests it's hardly worth the effort."}

On my first try this past Sunday, it was a tiny, mostly breadcrumb effort. The second sandwich was somewhat larger, but it too was mostly breadcrumbs. Tonight, I asked for the Manager and she agreed it wasn't cooked and offered to refund the cost. I readily accepted.\n\nSorry Mickey D's, the third time wasn't a charm. I'll pass in the future. Reducing my Four Stars to Two. The folks here are always friendly and helpful. The Manager handled this correctly (photo with coupon), so Two Stars over One Star."}

It's been 15 years now...I still don't know when they make new batches."}

This is my favourite location, check it out when you get the chance! You won't regret it!"}

They have a time limit for seating which depending on if it busy or not they may or may not enforce. The manager is usually good at doing this, she is pretty firm with this rule.\n\nThey take down your name instead of calling a number which kind of works. Thou someone has tried to take my order because John is so common\n\nAll in all its not great but its not bad"}
{"text":"It's McDonald's so you know what to expect from the food.  The restaurant has little seating and is usually busy so you're better-off getting your meal to go.  The staff doesn't really seem to like their jobs and are rarely really friendly, though this could be from the types of customers they have to put up with."}
{"text":"I can't say much about this place other than the fact it looks a million times better after the renovation and although not very roomy compared to other McDonald's, there always seems to be empty seats.  \n\nThe staff and service at this McDonald's are slightly better than most.  A lot of the times the cashier will take your name when you order drinks from the cafe, which is nice.  I know the late night staff are also fairly friendly considering the amount of sketchy people they must deal with each evening. \n\nMy favourite picks are the basic coffee and muffin combo, apple pies and extra value pick double cheese burgers.  You got to love that cheap extra value menu, with the prices of meals hitting almost $10!  \n\nHard to decide if I should get a McDonald's coffee or a Tim Hortons coffee sometimes, but McDonald's seems to be the better value!"}

{"text":"Neues Lokal am Flughafen, mit Parkplatz und Mc Drive, Softdrinks zum Nachf√ºllen, f√ºr den schnellen Hunger."}
{"text":"Der Standort des McDonalds am Flughafen hat sich im Gegensatz zur Beschreibung meiner Vorrednerin ge√§ndert; es gibt jetzt einen neu gebauten und erst vor zwei Wochen er√∂ffneten McDonalds.\n\n\n Es handelt sich dabei um ein schickes, neues Geb√§ude, dass halt eine normale McDonalds Filiale der neuesten Generation ist.\n\n\n Das bedeutet, dass es nat√ºrlich eine McCaf√© Filiale gibt sowie Free Refill f√ºr die Softdrinks.\n\n\n Vor dem Haus gibt es eine Parkplatzfl√§che, die eine halbe Stunde lang kostenfrei genutzt werden k√∂nnen.\n\n\n Leider merkte man bei meinem Besuch dem Team an, dass es erst seit zwei Wochen in diesem Restaurant arbeitete:\n\n\n Es ist nicht akzeptabel, dass wenn ich das Restaurant betrete und mich der Kasse n√§here, das Personal quatschend hinter dem Tresen steht, auch wenn das Restaurant leer ist. \nNach gef√ºhlten 30 Sekunden verkr√ºmelten sich dann die Mitarbeiter wieder an ihre Arbeitspl√§tze, bedient wurde ich jedoch erst gef√ºhlte 30 Sekunden sp√§ter.\n\n\n Nachdem ich als regelm√§√üiger McDonalds Besucher meine Bestellung so heruntergebetet hatte, dass sie m√∂glichst nachfragenfrei bleibt, f√ºhlte sich die Servicekraft √ºberfordert und bat eine Kollegin, zu √ºbernehmen.\n\n\n Diese Kollegin war dann in der Lage, mit meiner Bestellungsgeschwindigkeit mitzuhalten (ich h√§tte ja auch durchaus auf Anfrage abgebremst), verga√ü aber prompt, mir das Wechselgeld herauszugeben. Naja, wenigstens war sie nach einer Erinnerung sofort bereit, die Kasse erneut √∂ffnen zu lassen und so kam ich an mein Geld.\n\n\n Fazit: sehr schicker McDonalds mit Free Refill und anderem modernen Schnickenfittich mit leider noch nicht wirklich gut funktionierendem Team. Niveau der Speisen ist schon auf McDonalds Qualit√§tsstandard, Serviceniveau jedoch noch nicht. Warten wir mal die n√§chsten Wochen ab, auch wenn ich glaube, hier in den n√§chsten Monaten nicht mehr so schnell hinzugehen."}

Danach muss bezahlt werden und zwar nicht zu knapp (APCOA Parkhaus des Flughafens - da wird zugelangt).\n\n\n Wie soll man hier also hin kommen? Wenn man im P10 parkt ist es gut, aber vom Terminal hierher laufen ist ein kleines St√ºckchen und von der Autobahn abfahren lohnt sich wegen der Parkgeb√ºhren nur als Drive-In."}

Sch√∂n finde ich die Refill-Stationen, was bei McDonalds ja leider immer noch nicht Standard ist, und das Wi-Fi, dass eine kostenlose Stunde Surfen m√∂glich macht.

{"text":"Zu Zeiten des Lufhansa-Monopols f√ºr die Strecke Hamburg-Stuttgart trieb es mich fr√ºher h√§ufiger in den fr√ºhen Morgenstunden zu M√§ckdoof auf der Suche nach einem Fr√ºhst√ºck. Mit der ersten Maschine 'rein, das hei√üt um 3.50 aufstehen - da ist mir noch nicht nach Fr√ºhst√ºck. Und den Aufpreis f√ºr die Businessclass (ca. 300 EUR) damit man ein ein Pappbr√∂tchen essen kann, halte ich doch f√ºr etwas √ºbertrieben.\n\n\n Die Ausfahrt f√ºr die Leihwagen liegt auch gleich neben der Zufahrt f√ºr's Drive-In, eigentlich ganz praktisch. Kaffee und Egg McMuffin fassen und ab auf die Autobahn - man muss nur aufpassen, dass man sich unterwegs nicht die schicken Businessklamotten mit Fastfood bekleckert - das kommt nicht so gut. Essen und trinken beim Autofahren darf man ja noch, auch mit beiden H√§nden - nur Telefonieren ohne Freisprechanlage ist ja verboten. Macht ja nix, brauch' die H√§nde ja sowieso zum Essen.\n\n\n Vorher muss allerdings dieses Essen noch geordert werden, und das gestaltet sich h√§ufig schwierig. An der Rufs√§ule kann man schon mal 5 Minuten stehen, ohne nach seinem Begehr gefragt zu werden - inzwischen fahre ich nach sp√§testens einer Minute zum Ausgabeschalter um dort meine Bestellung abzugeben. H√§ufig stelle ich dann fest, dass die Servicedame das Headset abgelegt hat oder sich in intensiver Kommunikation mit Kollegen befindet. Ohnehin zeichnet sich die Lokalit√§t durch mi√ügelauntes, unaufmerksames Personal aus. An der Qualit√§t des Essens kann ja nicht viel verdorben werden, da es sich um eine Systemk√ºche handelt. Das betrifft allerdings nicht die Temperatur, die sonst bei diesem Anbieter vorgeschriebene Praxis, dass die Produkte nuir einen begrenzten Zeitraum in der Ausgabe verbringen d√ºrfen, wird hier vermutlich nicht ganz so strikt befolgt, wie erkl√§rt man sich sonst (bestenfalls) lauwarme Burger?\n\n\n Aber inwzischen muss ich den Notnagel nicht mehr h√§ufig einschlagen, denn es gibt ja die All-inclusive Billigairlines (dabei ist sogar eine der LH-T√∂chter), die Lufthansa das F√ºrchten lehren. Da gibt's Fr√ºhst√ºck und die Zeiten der Verkehrsgef√§hrdung sind vorbei."}

{"text":"I don't understand why an intelligent human being would go to this place and consume the stuff that this place sells. It is of less quality than the stuff they feed inmates at that tent prison in Arizona...literally. What McDonalds does is take some low quality beef, add soy and other mixtures for filler, and then flavor it with addictive chemical flavorings that they make in a lab. Look into it if you don't believe me. \n\nI cringe when my kids want to go there. It's so foul and not to mention freaking expensive. It's totally unbelievable to me that people eat there!"}

Also, if you ever have problems with any item they'll rapidly replace it for you.

In other countries, even during breakfast hours you can still order other regular hours menu items.."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. One great tip is going inside when there are a lot of cars waiting in drive through. It is a lot faster. They are good at what they do and the food does not taste old or as if it has been sitting around"}
{"text":"Another national chain spot that has no reviews. And with good reason. It's pretty pointless to review a McDonald's. That is, unless you want the FTR!\n\nMcDonald's to me is good for one thing--their dollar menu. I'm a sucker for the $1 McDouble and maybe some fries. On road trips, the $1 one-price-fits-all-sizes fountain drink is priceless. Unfortunately, not all McDonald's locations stick to this pricing structure, but this location certainly does.\n\nI've never actually been inside, but their drive-thru has the nice face-to-face three-window system. I'm not sure you need that third window just for ordering, but whatever. It works."}

{"text":"I go here so much that I'm starting to never want to go again. It's the closest and cheapest food place to my house.  It's cheap which I love and it's pretty good. It's McDonald's nothing special. Just cheap decent food when I need it. It's really fast too."}
{"text":"While outside it is advertised as a 24 hour drive thru, I waited 15 minutes with no service."}
{"text":"Can't really complain. I get my food on time nice and hot. Customer service inside and through the drive through have always been friendly. They forgot one of my sandwiches once but for the many times I have been here that is not too bad at all. \n\nThe inside could be a bit more cleaned up sometimes but nothing horrible. Also, it could have more seating available but it is what it is."}
{"text":"If I could give this location no stars at all, I wouldn't hesitate to do so. I visited this McDonalds this morning around 10:25, hungering for a sausage McMuffin. Much to my disappointment, the employee at the front counter told me that the manager had decided to end breakfast early (35 minutes early, exactly) and they could no longer serve any breakfast items. Several other customers expressed confusion and disappointment at this abrupt news, and I saw at least two or three other families leave. However, I was on my way to work and hungry, so I ordered a cheeseburger. I waited for this single item for almost 10 minutes, during which I saw SEVERAL drive-through customers being served pancakes, McMuffins, and other breakfast foods! All of the employees were rude and unfriendly and didn't seem concerned that their customers were upset about the breakfast time change. I definitely will not be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"This is my first negative review but this really pissed me off. Worst service ever. This lady was talking, eating, and drinking at the drive through window, knowing there are customers waiting. She literally made eye contact with us and did NOTHING."}
{"text":"Good service, food orders are always spot-on, and it's quick to boot.  For McDonald's, that seems to be extraordinary!\n\nBut seriously, their Drive-Thru is 24/7 and since it's down the street from my house that's fabulous if I come home in the wee hours.  Or, if I need to grab a quick bite before I drink spirits.  ;)\n\nThere's one guy there that's always extra-friendly and actually checks my ID -- on the back of my card it says \"See ID.\"  A+ to you, dude.\n\nP.S. Fries have always been crazy fresh (and we all know that's the best thing about McD's!)"}
{"text":"The food tends to be as good or better than the average McDonalds.  That's the good part.\nThe bad part is they don't seem to like McDonalds coupons there.

I don't expect overflowing but at least fill the container with the \"normal\" amount.  If I wanted a small fries I would have asked for that.  Don't come here between 330am and 430am because their \"system\" has to come down for maintenance.  They only take cash and I don't trust them enough to provide the right price."}
{"text":"Overview: This McDonald's is the closest McDonald's to the Charlotte Douglas Airport and the most convenient fast-food restaurant (tied with Wendy's next door) to eat or wait before or after an airport pickup. It offers both drive-through and dine-in options, and prepares your food faster than you can count the change to pay for your meal.\n\nThe Establishment: This McDonald's does not have a playpen but is very clean and has plenty of seating. I have never had to wait for a table, and the lines move very quickly. Good amount of parking, and close to a streetlight for easy an easy exit to back to the airport.\n\nThe Food: The same sloppy McDonald's assembly, but gosh I do love how the burgers taste. I always get some kind of burger variant (Big Mac, double-cheeseburger, etc) and I am never disappointed. The quality control between individual McDonald's chains makes it a safe bet if you actually enjoy McDonald's food. Pricing is on-par with other North Carolina McDonalds' and cheaper than anything you can find at the airport.\n\nThe Service: Slightly disgruntled looking employees but that food comes out so darn fast it doesn't matter.\n\nOverview: This McDonald's is clean, in a great location close to the CLT airport, and has good prices. While my aunt was sad that they don't have regional specials like the double-jalapeno cheeseburger, I cannot fault McDonald's for their taste. It's processed flour, ultra-processed meat, and high starch goodness."}
{"text":"So dirty I decided I could not eat here. Women's restroom had puddle of urine on floor in stall 1; an unflushed, full toilet in stall 2. I'll leave the odor to your imagination. I informed employee at counter of the mess, but I'm a little doubtful she cared."}
{"text":"I have seen better and I can't say that I've seen worse. This is a very small McD's with only a few tables inside and a couple outside. Watching the crew for a bit, they seemed to be taking quite a while to get orders together and get people out the door. I wouldn't recommend this one if you're in a rush.\n\nIt has the usual stuff of McDonald's - a Coke fountain, ice tea urns and napkin dispensers but ketchup only in packets. Credit card machines have the touchless sensors if your card supports that.\n\nOn the plus side, the dining room is open 24 hours and they have three power outlets next to bolted-down tables and chairs. The wifi works well and the parking lot is well lit. There is a TV but it wasn't on when I was here."}
{"text":"Hola, Bienvenido a McDonald's.\n\nThis is the absolute WORST McDonald's that I have EVER been to in my LIFE!   First off, the health grade never seems to be better than a 94 (http://mecklenburg.digitalhealthdepartment.com/facilities.cfm?facilityID=316649.)  Don't even bother ordering anything that will differ from the way the employees are trained to make it - forget about extra pickles, hold the onions, no ketchup, add mustard - it WILL NOT HAPPEN AT THIS MCDONALD'S!!!  One day, a man ahead of me at the counter simply wanted a PLAIN cheeseburger - JUST CHEESE AND MEAT!  He sent it back 2 times because they kept making it wrong.  Really?  Bread, cheese, meat - that's it.  How hard can it be??  When my simple little ole iced coffee came out wrong (after they had overcharged for it!) that same man smiled at me and said \"Good luck with THAT!\"  \nAs for the drive-thru?  I've had to jump out of it too many times to count because after I had placed my order at the speaker, we never seemed to move along.  If the car at the pick-up window is waiting on something that is taking an extra long time, YOU will have to wait also.  They don't have that car pull out of line for an employee to bring them their item(s) when ready.  OH NO!!!   EVERYBODY in line has to wait!!    \nDon't bother calling any 800 # about this McDonald's - it's useless.  One would think that the owner of this location would be more proactive in making it a better McDonald's, but after more than 6 years of the same kind of service (or lack thereof!)  I guess not.  The only reason I ever went to this location was because it is close to my work, and options are pretty limited.  But now?  I can't even go back because it's such a waste of time & money."}
{"text":"We pull up to the drive thru of the McDonalds that's open 24 hours and wait five plus minutes because they were having a \"shift change\" and then they tell us it's cash only and then they tell us the have no quarter pounder beef! Crazy. We should have gone to Wendy's across the street. But don't worry about me I'm just hangry over here."}
{"text":"We only went through the drive-thru and the service was pretty quick with not many cars to serve. My breakfast burritos had hard corners like were bad or cooked to long. They were also folded kind of weird, like all four corners under instead of bottom, left, and right, and like some effort was actually put into them. It's also kind of shabby they offer water at the same price and a regular drink. I'm not looking for free, but at least half the price of drink that have to be ordered and delivered. We are talking about water here, simply water. The ice coffees on the other hand were at least made with a generous amount of flavor. The were yummy and definitely worth my dollar. The staff should also work on communication, instead seemed a bit aggressive and not very personable."}
{"text":"The ice cream machine is Always broken after 9pm AMAZING, this is 6 out of 6 attempts AMAZING.  This is at the McDonald's at the entrance to the airport, really the Ice-cream machine is Always broken after 9?"}
{"text":"Of course I got in line behind someone who wanted a detailed explanation of the price difference between a la carte or a meal. Believe it or not, the supervisor noticed the line forming behind me and had another cashier open her register.\n\nThe coffee was hot, if only I had checked he bag before I left to see if the creamers I asked for where in there, all would have been good.\n\nAs mentioned by others, this location is right by the airport."}
{"text":"I would never review a McDonald's normally, but I have to review this one because its so disgusting. Every single time I go its dirty, every time. Tables, benches, whatever it is, dirty. The food is usually below average and the workers barely speak English. Go somewhere else (PLEASE!!) instead and skip this place."}
{"text":"most dysfunctional team I have ever seen at McDonald.  Plus an overflowing urinal. Don't go here"}
{"text":"I honestly wish I can give this place no stars. Okay, okay. It's a mcdonalds, nothing to rave about but the fact that they have the *excuse my language* SHITTEST customer service erks me. I use to go here often because I went to CPCC harris campus. 8/10 times they would get my order wrong somehow but that's not the point. The thing that annoys me is how one worker tried to blame ME for the wrong order. Seriously.. this mcdonalds needs to get their shit together."}
{"text":"You're not going here because you want a bite to eat, you're going here bc you are waiting for someone to pick up at the airport or just dropped someone off in the morning and are craving an Egg McMuffin.  My case is the latter.\n\nSlow service, perhaps due to shift change or morning rush (at 630AM).  I waited in drive-thru at the ordering part, and it took them 8 minutes to take my order.  They forgot a package of salsa they asked me to choose one.  And those sheisty folks at McD put ice in my orange juice--like half a cup of ice.\n\nHaven't been inside so I have no idea.\n\ndmo out."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  Came in to a VERY clean store,  and the cashier was not only polite, she was actually NICE!  My order was taken quickly, my food came quickly and the whole experience was an exercise in what fast food is supposed to be!   Whoever is responsible for keeping this store up (whether it's an independent store or not) should have the other McDonald's trainees come here to learn how to be exemplary employees with whom customers actually enjoy interacting!  \n\nFreshly made food served fast, lovely personnel, and a clean store make this a fast food 'restaurant' worth visiting.  Thank you so much for restoring my faith in other branches of customer service staff, and thanks for making my breakfast - it was right on time, even with the crowd of a quincanera in the house!   W00T!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I found this McDonald's in need of a good cleaning.  Everywhere I looked, it needed washed down with clean soapy water and debris washed off all vertical fixtures. No one smiled, and my coffee order was messed up. \n\nOn the positive side, it was fairly quick. But no one seemed happy or to be taking pride in their work."}
{"text":"I'm at the airport 2 to 3 times a week. Mickey D' s is a great place to wait for arrivals. They understand if you're going to chill for awhile. Free WI Fi and free refills. When you get the call. 60 seconds to baggage claim."}
{"text":"The Positives:  if you are parked in the lot you can enjoy watching planes take off and land\n\nThe Negatives: Slow Drive Thru Line\n\n                         Incorrect Order as mine was\n\n                         The redneck woman in the car behind me honking, as if that would make \n                         the worker go faster - he probably couldn't even hear her, but I could\n\n                         Tea so sweet you have to wait for the ice to melt\n\n                         Sorry my spacing is so weird"}
{"text":"Because I was on first light standby, I got to the breakfast counter as soon as it opened.  I counted four employees, and two customers, and another couple of customers arriving before I left this splendid eatery.  The cashier took my order and my money, then told my order to the prep people who slumped only a couple of feet away from her.  I waited.  And waited.  \n\nThe alleged biscuit on my breakfast sandwich was probably yesterday's version of a croissant,  Soggy, flat, gooey.  Yuk.  While I was examining this mess, the prep employee told the poor Eastern European guy who was struggling with English that \"there ain't no bar-ree-toes wadja want?\"  yikes.  Even repeating it wasn't going to help the visitor (or me) to understand that advice.  The visitor was a lot more nimble than I would have been in his position.  He glanced up at the menu board and defaulted to another combo number.  Doubt he even knew what would be handed to him. What I doubted even more was the situation. A cashier at the start of business doesn't know that there are menu items missing from the kitchen.  Then she continues to take money from arriving customers for the missing \"Bar-ree-toes.\" \n\n I just don't have much of an appetite for that kind of weirdness at any time of day."}
{"text":"What a culture shock! This is the first time I've been to a McDonald's predominantly taken over by minorities (Chinese and East Indians - guess they aren't minorities in this neighbourhood), and seniors! \n\nAt 10:00am, it would have been a struggle to find a free spot for a group of 4 as the seniors were content with the bottomless coffee refills to complete their idle days. \n\nIf you're a young buck, or a young family, used the drive-thru; unless, you need to use their facilities. They have one of the cleanest facilities of all the McDonald's I've visited - BTW. Great pit stop location as well, plenty of stores and restaurants nearby with ample parking should you be in the area."}
{"text":"They have implemented the self-service machines!!!!!! \nSuper happy about it because \n1) I haven't seen it in Toronto yet and\n2) IT'S AWESOMEEEE!! \nSuper smooth and fast technology. I cut the line by so much because it is past 3PM, so all the kids are out and ofc, in McDonald's. I didn't have to wait behind 6 people because the machine was available :D .\n\nYou choose what you want, and you're able to see your \"cart\" at the bottom of the large screen. Options to pay by cards or at the counter. The machine prints out your receipt, which you should hold onto incase they want to verify that it is your order. \n\nI only bought an ice cream (because the weather lately has been beautiful!! and because I'm in a McDs ice cream phase right now). So I skipped past the crowds once again. And service for my ice cream was fast - which what I had expected.\n\nThis McDs is 24 hours, has multiple tvs, a fireplace which emits heat in the winter, and quite an ample space if I do say so myself. Their drinks and condiments are self-service so you can sit here and refill your drink non-stop basically...\n\nIn the morning, most old people come here to read newspapers and chill with coffees. Whereas after 3PM, high school kids fill the spots. I used to come here at night quite a bit as it was the only 24hr McDs here. \n\nI'm happy at the self-service machine!! So exciting, and this is the first time I'm seeing it. I wish the Eaton Centre had this but they might get a bit crazy on the orders....."}
{"text":"Very bad service and always missed something from drive thru. Almost 3 out of 5 times they made mistake. Terrible"}
{"text":"I grew up at this McDonalds and have seen it change over the years. I remember when this McDonalds was still a part of the Woodside Square mall where the current  Pizza Pizza is. \n\nThis McDonalds is pretty popular. It doesn't matter what time of day/night you go...there will always be a line up. The service is fast and efficient, and the food is the same every where you go. The free wifi is a plus, with a few tvs in the mix."}
{"text":"Sort of ticked they have no outlets to plug in your laptop. Always busy! It's McDonald's so you know what to expect."}
{"text":"There is no playplace here and no refill your own soda fountain.  There is ample parking and the crew is friendly.  Just have to be careful in the parking lot as the locals here are not the best of drivers... So BE WARNED!!!  Food here is typical McD's quality and the prices on the higher spectrum of the pricing range with exception to the set price value meals.  Bright and airy with lots of single seating available"}
{"text":"We literally walked in and walked right out. The line up was completely disorganized and people were very agitated. Really surprised to see a multi-billion dollar company with a location this badly managed."}
{"text":"Food was on par with what you'd expect to get from a McD. Fries weren't soggy. That was nice. I used my mailer coupons that are now available through their website. The restaurant was clean, but they oddly had a rule for soft drinks. If you dine in, you can refill the drinks yourself, but there's a sign that says you can only get one refill. That's new."}
{"text":"I eat McDonald's probably 1-2 times a year, but sometimes you just crave a double quarter pounder with cheese. Ya know? This one is across the street from my part-time, so it's usually a waited-way-too-long-to-eat-lunch-now-I'm-starving-and-I-want-food-right-meow trip."}
{"text":"My son just found a large piece of fingernail in his smoothie. Need I say more? The manager on duty offered us a coupon for a free meal, but I don't think I could ever eat there again!"}
{"text":"We just got ice cream cones as a family and the workers were awesome!!! We asked for extra large cones and they definitely made them XL! Fast service for a quick, cheap treat!"}
{"text":"WOW! I was in a hurry, so I went here again fully expecting the same bad experience. What a surprise!  I was immediately greated with a sincere and cheerful \"hello\" from a employee that I later found out was the manager today. Her name is Rosie. I used to go out of my way to avoid this McDonald's location due to bad experiences every time I was stupid enough to come here. I really hope the owner of this McDonald's reads this. Rosie made me feel welcome and happy to be here. If Rosie had been here instead of some opressive manager with bad people skills, I would never have given your store such a bad review. I did not feel the stress and oppression in the work environment today, and it was lunch time! Rosie effectively managed her crew without making them or the customers stressed out. Please put Rosie in charge of training all your managers how to effectively manage without being a careless slave master with a whip. You will get more customers if the overall atmosphere is pleasant than when you have managers barking out orders and creating a hostile atmosphere. Rosie, you made me feel good today, which is something rare. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through and when I went to pay, the cashier was having a personal conversation with a co-worker and also taking an order. Her only form of acknowledgement to me was for her to stick her hand out for my payment. I am 100% certain I handed her exact change. She went about her business talking to everyone else, didn't offer me a receipt so I pulled forward. When I got to the second window the person wouldn't give me my food because the cashier said I was .25 short. I explained to her that I counted out my money (exact change) while NOT being distracted but she still demanded the quarter. I gave it to her because I wanted my food but damn, worst customer service experience ever."}
{"text":"This is the only super consistent McDonalds I have ever been to. I have been here probably six times over eight months and the customer service is always great. The lobby is always clean. The food orders have always been correct in the lobby and drive thru. The food is always as fresh as it gets for McDonalds and doesn't look thrown together."}
{"text":"I think I may have food poisoning after eating here 4-5 hours ago. Achy joints, running to the bathroom, chills... Friggin' McDonalds."}
{"text":"My Husband and I go up every day and meet a group up there around 8 A.M/ and the staff is wonderful and it is always clean and a friendly place to be. the food is good and we love there iced Coffee"}
{"text":"I can't say I'm a huge fan of McDonald's in general. But this location is literally right across the street... so sometimes when I'm feeling lazy, I'll grab some grub there.\n\nNormally I'd give McDonalds 2 stars, but today when I stopped by here with the boyfriend... we waited. And waited. The boyfriend decided to go up to the counter to inquire about our order and not only did they apologize multiple times, but they gave us free large fries and 2 free apple pies.\n\nSo, thanks McDonalds! I like free food. :)"}
{"text":"The food is usually fresh. The only problem is they have some SALTY ass fries. It never fails, no matter what time or day I go they are always super salty. Hate it."}
{"text":"Although we don't regularly frequent McDonalds for food, but rather the sweet tea, cookies, frappes etc.; tonight was an exception as we headed home from an evening out downtown with east coast guest who wanted a bite.  I was embarrassed that we were in line for over 15mins.  There were approx 5 cars ahead of us....\nSouthwestern Salad\nHot Cakes & Sausage\nChocolate Chip Cookies\nCaramel Sundae\nI actually placed the car in park, as I feared falling asleep as the wait was soooo long. After waiting more than 5 mins to pay, a few mins to get to the pick up window and over 5 mins sitting waiting on the salad, I began and finished my sundae (and I'm not a fast eater).  I was told that the salad was being made, upon my inquiry on the delay.  They never asked me to pull around for them to bring out the salad, for which I began feeling badly for the cars waiting behind us.\nThe salad was handed to me on its side without acknowledgment or apology for the elongated wait.  What the heck... just RIDICULOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Free Wi-Fi.  Dining is open 24 hours you can't go wrong. The service has gotten much better. I get a Mcdouble every time I'm here. No regilar bun only ketchup and pickles $1.39.  Fries are always fresh. I ask for no added salt. Thank you Jessica."}
{"text":"This place really sucks! Slow as shit. Only reason I go here is cause nothing is close by. Hire some new workers or get your shit together."}
{"text":"Yeah, I eat at McDonald's. What of it? I am hooked on breakfast sandwiches, okay?  Leave me alone. I don't care if it's a $20 breakfast sandwich from room service or a $3 sandwich from McDonald's. Addicted.\n\nThis particular McDonald's is in a gas station, which is pretty dope. And this is a good stop if you're headed to Lee Canyon for skiing.\n\nFish tank!  There is one at this McDonald's. Say again, fish tank!"}
{"text":"I Absolutely like this place the stuff is so very nice and Friendly some are know me there They always tell me I know you you always here lol!!  I feel like am home lol!!! My daughter favorite play place area..."}
{"text":"What a crappy slow drive thru in the mornings! Because there's 2 order screens, your order can easily get mixed up if stupid drivers cut in front of you.  Bad call McDonald's.  \n\nFood was slapped on.  But hey, that's why it's fast food."}
{"text":"Something is fishy about this McDonalds. That is all the fishes swimming in the awesome aquarium in the heart of the dining area. This is no ordinary aquarium. It is an aquatic garden. McDonalds made what would've been an ordinary McDonalds attached to a Chevron into a fun restaurant to dine in. Children seemed amazed by the fish. There are seats arranged around the aquarium, that offer closeup views. For guests who are drinking a beverage, there are more comfortable lounge seats that overlook the aquarium.\n   I was happy with the service, food, and overall experience.\n  BTW, I uploaded two pictures of the aquarium this businesses Yelp page."}
{"text":"went with daughter to get a happy meal ordered in drive thru also ordered two pumpkin pies, noticed when we arrived home that happy meal did not have a toy in it and we did not receive pumpkin pies we received one sundae?? and these are the employees that are complainig that they do not make $ 15.00 a hour! what a joke."}
{"text":"Man every fucking time I come here it's long ass lines....it's like these Mutha fuckers ain't got shit prepared..... I go inside and it's even longer... why the fuck am I gunna come pay for this cheap ass shit....I can take my money els where and actually enjoy the shit.. just straight retarded who the fuck is running this shit...."}
{"text":"The weekday morning crew between 7-9 is the best. I come here almost every morning during that time."}
{"text":"Came through at a busy time. Gave them my order and go figure. It was wrong. Called and they offered to replace my sandwich."}
{"text":"365 days a year the slowest McDonald's ever. Everyone always giving attitude. Managers sometimes provide good service but not always. \n\nEither hire more people or more competent people."}
{"text":"I live down the street from this McDonald's so I've been here more times than I'd like to admit but the mornings are always really busy. They usually have the bozos working the night shift so make sure you check your order before driving off."}
{"text":"Do not go to this location!!!!! They charge you more compare to other location and give u repackage food!!  I order a southwest salad with grill chicken, got home ready to eat when I see that there are some other dressing on the salad and the veggie looked old, the grill chicken was cold.  I was so disgusted and have to throw it out."}
{"text":"What can I say about McDonald's??? Picking up food for my mother in law and wifey, mom specifically requested a Big Mac so up I go for a 5 minute drive. \n\nI ordered nuggets, fries and a Big Mac. Guy took my order accurately. I pulled up and told him I'd be paying with Apple Pay, he put the scanner out the window and a second later my order is payed for. Apple Pay is soooo convenient. \n\nSince I ordered like 30 nuggets I asked for extra ketchup which the girl in the second window was nice enough to include. The whole process was probably less than 4 minutes. Fast food was fast. The nuggets were spicy which was weird but I like spicy so it's all good in the hood. \n\nWifey and mom enjoyed their food, will be coming here again in the near future due to working in the area."}
{"text":"We love this for daddy-daughter dates!!! We get to enjoy our love for the ocean by sitting at the 2000 gallon salt aquarium, $1 Sundaes and the magical toy you get in a happy meal box.\nAnd always the gentleman named Osmel that watches over the dining area remembers my daughter every time ! She won't go if he's not there! Such pride in his work .\n\nThanks for a special place to go.\n\nGreat service again. Still trying to find Dori & Nemo!"}
{"text":"When you order two items, one being cookies and the other an ice cream cone totaling a whopping $1.62 is it too much to expect your order to be correct. Guess I just ask for too much. I get handed my cookies and the lady says have a great day. I said that we ordered an ice cream cone also and we didn't get it. She proceeds to tell us to drop the attitude and that is where we developed one. The manager didn't exactly help the situation as he seemed to have lost his spine on the way to the window. Sadly customer service is at a loss at McDonalds. Fortunately I don't frequent them. If they want a lesson in customer service, visit the Dutch Brothers on E Tropicana. They are the gold standard!!"}
{"text":"If could give this McDonald's 0 stars I would. I ordered my food 3 times. First the intercoms intertwined. Second times was in person and she confirmed the order that was wrong so I reiterated my order and she still got it wrong. Now mind you I don't expect ivy leagues to be working a fast food drive thru but I couldn't imagine how hard it is to get the correct order when it's told to you. It's a five second memory thing. Not a memorization of the acidity of red blood cells in a cancerous cells. Jimmy, a fatter man than most, had a huge attitude issue, then refuse to correct my order because I didn't pay .69 cents to receive the pie I had order THREE times. I'm appalled at the way he treated me and the fact that he didn't fix my order correctly not only with the pie but with the sandwhich he gave me the wrong order again. Mind you he's not a person who took English honors but I would think he could understand sausage and egg mcmuffin when he works at MCDONALDS!!!!! Anyways I tried to give back all my food and get a refund and he refused to give my money back pretty sure better business bureau won't be happy and the supposed franchise owner \"Fresco\" (highly doubt his name is fresh but w.e) won't be please either. Jimmy f u, I hate your hermaphradite looking ass, I hope your Apple Watch (it was probably a knock off version Motowatch) knocks and breaks against the pie machine and you think of me."}
{"text":"I know its just McDonalds not the White House but they could have better personality. Everyone there is just so dry and impersonal.\nI only go there if I'm really in a last minute bind."}
{"text":"Fast drive thru and really good service. I feel like no matter what the line looks like, it still moves pretty quick. \n\nMcDs is always the same. Same food, cheap prices. love the Choc chip Frape and Vanilla Latte is my favorite. Starbucks is nice, but don't sleep on the coffee products here."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. I was in the drive thru for almost 10 minutes and then they had me wait in the parked spot for another 5. I had to go inside to retrieve the rest of my order.  I talked to a lady in a blue shirt, and I watched her service 10 other in store customers before she got to my order, which was sent 15 minutes ago. Terrible service overall."}
{"text":"Been to this Mcdees many times. The food has always been fresh, hot, the service prompt and friendly. Clean restaurant and restrooms."}
{"text":"Awesome aquarium display, clean, and fast service Rare to find a worker happy to do his job, he made everyone feel welcome, he was interacting with all customers, not really with me.. But his personality brought a smile to my face ( good enough for me =). )  just by hearing him with other guests and the kids, a mom was ordering and her little boy kept trying to talk and ask him for a toy, he didn't ignore him and wasn't rude he just said let me take your Mommys order first and you'll have to ask mommy If you can have a toy.  Kudos to you for not ignoring the lil boy ! Definitely good vibes... Very friendly and outgoing . Only wish I caught his name , your an awesome guy !"}
{"text":"Don't go here if you are in a rush.  The drive through is SO SO SO slow...... but if you do go, then make sure you check your order before driving off.  We routinely avoid this location and go out of our way to another one just because they always get your order wrong.  Without fail they will get your order wrong.  We have even called and told the manager several occasions and they give us a free meal which helps, I guess.  We dont' eat at Mcdonald's a lot but when we do my kids love the toys in the happy meals...... Yeah, well you need to check for those too cause they often times forget them.  It's so sad to get home and see your kid open his happy meal in excitemnt for the newest toy and BAM.  Nothing.  :("}
{"text":"Early morning stop , was not very happy, worst McDonalds ever.\nGreasy meat, dry muffins, orange juice seemed to be watered down, horrible service,  it seemed like we were a inconvenience to them.\nWill not return to this location."}
{"text":"This McDonald's really pisses me off! They love to play games in the morning especially on weekends! I have been on several occasions and without any exaggeration I kid you not you will wait a minimum of 10 minutes!! I decided to YELP about it this time because it was a total of 14 minutes which in all honesty is beyond ridiculous! What is the point of you calling your business establishment a \"fast food\" place or hell even a drive-thru? More like a sit and park thru? Nah I'm good I will drive up to the McDonald's of Tropicana and fort Apache from here on out since they seem to be understaffed on weekend morning! To top it all off I get to the window to inquire with the employee as to why the hell it took so long and she nonchalantly answers \"oh it's not that bad we are just understaffed\" o said oh really? 14 minutes in your drive thru isn't that bad?! o_O hmmph!"}
{"text":"Every time  I came here:\nLong lines\nShort staffed\nNot accepting cards only cash \nOut of certain things \nParking lot small\nPeople playing loud music in their car you can't hear the speakers in the drive thru\nNot a good area to be in general nor a good store to buy food from :/\nNasty parking lot\nPeople cutting you off cause drive thru have two ways to enter but only one poll to order from.\nFries cup is half full not completely full of fried\nStaff is very polite and helpful not their fault this business/building is old/things are broken"}
{"text":"grabbed the family food, waited 20 minutes in drive thru. was told everything was in the box- left and checked---fries,-  cheeseburger and both my drinks were never given- i waited so long, i forgot about my drinks until i left. had to come back---the doors inside were locked inside of course--now back in the drive thru with 3 cars ahead of me to get something i should have gotten a while ago...was so convinced everything was in the box like the dummy employee mentioned-should have known better and checked at the window."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and they always seem to keep the store clean compared to others.\n\nTry the sugar free vanilla iced coffee it's simply the best! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"There this lady name Melissa and she was great . She 1st mess up my order but how she handle it was great . Normally ppl blame others in the back . You know that ppl you can't see . But Melissa was like . Hey my bad. You can keep the mess up order and I'll be you another one . That's the basic but she gone all out like I got free coffee while I waited and I got a card where the next meal on them . I only spand 3 dollars and I walked out with 10 dollars worth of food . \n\nSo hears a shout out to Melissa"}
{"text":"It tells you something about the area of town when you have to ask the cashier to unlock the restroom door.  My friends and I were hungry on shop moving day and they chose McDonald's.  We each had Big Macs.   They were not as good as I remembered them.  The meal for three of us was under $10 though including a couple of drinks and some fries."}
{"text":"This place is crap!  I was told to wait 4 minutes for pumpkin pies to cook, so park in parking lot.  After 10 mins, employee came out and tried to substitute apples pies but I refused.  I went inside after 25 mins and asked about pies, manager went into back and after a couple of mins,  brought the 2 pumpkin pies, plus 2 more \"for my trouble\".  I complained about the rest of my order being cold now and was told \"sorry\" by cashier.  I finally left the restaurant exactly 30 mins from the time on the receipt.  When I got home, I discovered that the fries were missing from the happy meal as well as the sweet and sour sauce that I requested plus all the food was cold."}
{"text":"Service is good... Wish I can say the same for their food; it's a 50/50 shot that you'll either get both out either or :/\nGrades:\nService: A-\nFood quality: C-"}
{"text":"Horrible.  I ordered a sausage mcgriddle with bacon and I got a sausage cheese mcgriddle. I also went to use the restroom and neither stall had toilet paper. And the cashier thought it was funny. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Dropped by there for breakfast this morning thinking maybe this time this location will finally get it right. No such luck. The staff was nice and friendly but the food was the same old overcooked mess its been each time I've gone there before. My biscuit was dry and hard and my latte tasted scorched. Well I'm done with them. Guess I will just have to drive a little futher into Concord from now on if I want something that actually tastes like McDonald's is supposed to taste."}
{"text":"We have small kids and this is the worst McD by far.  We go by this one from time to time and kids want to go but this one is horrible.  Obviously the ownership is cheap and trying to squeeze every penny of profit they can out.  Ketchup is always out, tea is empty, items missing from the order every time.  The Taco Bell and Zaxby are 100 times better.  Avoid this one."}
{"text":"I wrote amount this place a month ago, however I just sat in the Drive Thru FOR 10 SOLID MINUTES and absolutely NO movement.  The owner of this franchise needs to sell it to someone that's remotely competent because this seems to be the theme there.  There were 17 cars in front of me and they managed to move NO ONE in 10 minutes.  I couldn't go in because I had went barefoot.  How hard is it to collect funds and hand someone food.  I worked at McDonald's when I was a teenager and even when we were slammed or issues would arise we knew you have a 2 minute window from placing your order to food pickup.  I've also managed before, if you have these type of issues constantly then the issue is you and not because you're busy.  I know 2 people that worked there and moved over to Dukin' Donuts and they say it's night and day regarding competence and management.  Seriously, how are you this incompetent?!  It doesn't even deserve a star but it won't let me do zero."}
{"text":"I mean it's McDonald's... So what can you expect? A McDonald's. I can say that the employees are very kind and they accomadations the lines quite quickly which was fantastic because I was super hungry! The food came out hot and fresh. The bathrooms and the tables left little to be desired however they were mostly clean and there is a lot of seating!!!"}
{"text":"We have gone to this McDonald's  often and our experience  has not been well. In one week I got orders free because the cashier I think he didn't really care. I placed an order and then gave him a coupon for a free icecream cone...he looked confused and gave me the order free. Again that same week  it happened again. I asked if I could speak to a manager but they were too busy. I am 54 years old and not looking for a freebie.Been in corporate America too long. So today we went to get a large fry and $10.00 dollar gift certificate. They were out of gift  cards and large fry packs so we got one medium fry and one small. I just feel bad for the owners  because they are loosing a lot of money. If it has happened to us I am sure it has happened to others. The cashiers  would rather converse with their friends rather than taking care of the customers. Today was the last straw we will be going to the McDonalds onhwy. 601, Concord, NC\n\n\n\n\n\n."}
{"text":"McDonald's is McDonalds right?\n\nUsually when I go here its to be in and out since I'm usually on a lunch break this place is RARELY not packed. They are always busy nonstop its crazy. The parking lot is so small that its a fight at times just to be able to get into the place.\n\nFrom my understanding this is an individually own place and not fully connected to the normal franchises. So if there is ever and issue you've got to actually contact the manager at the store to get the issues fixed.\n\nEither way I stopped today to get some McNuggets and the golden arch fries. It sucks knowing that by the time I get the food and drive literally across the street that as soon as I bite into my nuggets they have been cooked so long and sat for so long that they are like a rock. It was like chewing rubber trying to eat the nuggets. The fries were all soggy and cold def a waste of money trying to get food here. But the Coke was good go figure.\n\nIf you are wanting McDonald's go stop at another one because this one will just be one big upset."}
{"text":"My order is always wrong when I finally get it. They are also out of the most popular items (i.e. the multiple times they had no soda????)\n\nYou would think McDonalds is McDonalds, don't have high expectations but I expect to have some basic things in place."}
{"text":"McDonalds is McDonalds is McDonalds.  I stopped by this location on my way to an occasion in Concord.  The little one had a 4-piece nugget meal and the fries were hot.  After sampling her fries, I was prompted to go back and get a cheeseburger and fries.  Unfortunately, my fries were not as hot and they were on the burnt side.  The second time up, I did not hit them at the right time!  Oh well...the restaurant is one of the newer models and had a good flow of people inside and at the drive-through.  The only fault was that I noticed there were a few flies in the window sill but thankfully they did not come near our table."}
{"text":"McDonald's is McDonald's but this one seriously should be de-arched. Who regularly runs out of Diet Coke? This place.  Ice cream machine is typically broken. The only time you might get food at proper temperature is if it's slammed busy...if you have time to wait. Order accuracy is hit and miss, & mostly miss. Poorly managed.  Skip this place & go to Hardee's or Highway 55 for burgers and grease."}
{"text":"This has been one of the worst managed McDonalds I know of.  Through many visits over the years I have been extremely disappointed over and over.  They often get orders wrong, don't have certain menu items in stock, poor good quality.  Went there today thru the drive thru and they came over the intercom and said the drive thru is closed and you will need to come inside to place your order.  This is just one of many issues they have.  They truly do not represent what McDonalds is about."}
{"text":"This McDonalds location is close to the intersection of Yonge and Alexander Streets and is is busy during most evenings.  Menu at this location is the same as other Canadian locations in Toronto.  This location tends to attract many local hobos and other odd residents during evening hours due the fact that it's opened 24 hours.  Order turn-around time is very slow and the staff try to do a good job in making sure tables are kept clean as many patrons leave their trays, wrappers, newspapers, etc., behind. This location could use some remodeling as other stores nearby have gone through recently in order to give it a more warm, friendly feel."}
{"text":"Has your typical McDonald's food with a McCafe included. They're currently installing the machines for you to order/pay at and then you can pick up your food from the counter later, so it's a bit loud with all the construction going on inside. Service is standard, nothing terrible like some of the reviews here suggest, at least from the handful of times I've visited either in the early morning for breakfast or for a late night snack. Service is relatively quick and this place is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Gawd awful service.  \n\nThis is not a food critique.  It's McDonalds.  It is what is is.\n\nBut what it is about is the WORST service ever at a McD's.  Across all shifts and all different employees.  IDK if its shitty due to lack of staff or if they can't keep staff cause its shitty to work there.  Either way it shouldn't take 7 minutes for a large Ice Tea.  Serious. 7 minutes.  Or the time I ordered 2 double hamburgers, waited almost 10mins, got only single patties.  Watched her throw them in garbage when all I needed was a patty taken out of the plastic tray that keeps it warm and put on the damn things.  Wasteful. And another 8mins.  And a snotty and dismissive attitude when the MANAGER gives me my order eith no apology for mix up or wait.  I hate that this place is across the street from me and is 24hours.  \nlousy customer experience and a lot of homeless hanging around as well.  And the washrooms are usually dirty. So yay."}
{"text":"We all have been there... as adults, and know it. \n\nYou know, I know, we all know: McDonald's is bad for you. Generally unhealthy and greasier than the inside of a container of grease. \n\nWhere a tiny, minuscule burger has over 1/3 of your daily intake of fat and sodium. Yum. \n\nHowever it's early in the morning, you are in a rush and there is NOTHING else open. You have no choice. You are a hungry, you need to be somewhere and you know chances are you that after, you will feel mildly abhorred and confused. \n\nSince if you are like me, you do recall the stuff as pretty tasty and good when you were a kid. \nOh, these discombobulated childhood memories! ;-)\n\nOkay, all that thoughts aside, these place, about one block north of Yonge and College (west corner) is about are standard issue McD's as it gets. Somewhat sombre in looks but clean. It's open 24hr for those hungry or with a complete disregard of the meaning of 'healthy eating.'\n\nStill I will eat it any day than starve. So yes, McD's you saved that morning."}
{"text":"This MacDonald's is slower than the average and always has lots of local colour. It's jammed day and night, even up to 11. Took me 10 minutes to get two McChicken and a mcdouble a few nights ago...."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, I like their fries and Big Mac. And I'm not here to wonder when this patty was made or if the fries came from fresh potatoes. The combo is nothing extraordinary, but I like the thought that I know what to expect. I know how it taste and the familiarity of it is dare I say, comforting. So overall, I have to say I like this location as it was clean and the staff was nice. It seems to be run better than most McDonald's which resulted in good standards for food quality. The food was made better than most McDonald's which is probably skewing the ratings a little. P.S. my fries weren't soggy. =)"}
{"text":"Mcdonald's isn't really all that great, and of course this location is no exception.\n\nThe food is really low quality greasy stuff, your typical fast food junk.  There is a decent variety of items to choose from on their menu and the prices are really dirt cheap but this doesn't really make up for the lack of quality.  \n\nThis location has a good size for a downtown Mc D's store but for whatever reason it seems like every time I've been here (which has only been 3-4 times) there always seems to be hobos hustling the customers out of some change.  I'd probably like this location a bit better if i didn't have a slight chance of getting knifed every time I go.\n\nBetter off going to another location, or another restaurant all together."}
{"text":"I live really close to this place, and for one of the busiest McDonald's I have ever been to, I can't believe how understaffed the place is.\n\nDon't even think of going in here on a weekend after midnight... you will end up waiting 15 minutes to order and another 15 minutes to receive your order.\n\nI realize it is one of the few that are open 24/7 in the downtown core, but this place is a disgrace.  I would rather drive to another location that is open late than walk here and wait for cold food.  \n\nThe one good thing is that it keeps me from eating the pseudo food, that is serverd at McDonald's!"}
{"text":"New order-pickup system is horrible. Results in extremely long wait times to get your food. Very disappointed here"}
{"text":"McDonald's, 470 Yonge St.\n\nA star off for having lots of empty tables, cleared by the previous eater but not washed by McD staff.  Very dirty.\n\nAnother star off for not using real cutlery and plates for dining in.  I know that no McD uses anything but plastic and paper, but still I find it irresponsible to put that much plastic into the environment, I don't care who you are.  How much trouble can it be to wash a few dishes, and that would have to be cheaper than constantly throwing away plastic.\n\nAnother star off for serving me a McRib. even though I asked for it.  They should be ashamed to charge over $5 for that skimpy bit of flavourless ground up pork on a cold bun they call a rib.  It is over-processed and has no resemblance to ribs.  The sliced onions were tough and smelled odd.  Never again will I order a McRib, it is a big rip-off.\n\nAside from that, what's with pushing coffee to the point of leaving some burger items off the menu due to the space taken up by coffee advertising?  For one thing, after trying it several times, I still find their coffee bitter and heavy, so I am going to give up on that.  To me McDonald's is a burger place, but I think they are pushing the coffee shop thing because it is easier for them and hopefully more profitable.  I will never think of McDonald's as a coffee shop, no matter how much they try to force me to.  To be fair, Wendy's is doing that too to a lesser extent, so I avoid Wendy's too."}
{"text":"The worst service. Such a long wait for anything! Even coffee! Dirty inside and the wheelchair accessible doesnt seem to be ever working. Unpleasant staff that cannot handle requests like no mustard on a hamburger. Seemed to annoyed by everything. Disappointed every time I make the mistake of go there."}
{"text":"Jeffrey used to be the manager (thank God his useless self doesn't work there anymore) and he used to check out the younger kids. Mind you, he's a lottt older. I've also heard his racist comments about black people when I'd order food from time to time. It's pathetic that the owners would keep him around.\n\nAnd there's this woman named Julie who was super rude and acted like she owned the store, but no honey. You make $11/hr. Humble yourself. She gave me attitude and refused to give me a new drink when she gave me a wet cup. Can we say lazy?\n\nThis place has a reputation to keep disrespectful employees for as long as they can."}
{"text":"Well it's a McDonald's so I knew what to expect going in: cheap, fast, reasonably tasty food. There's wifi. Interior is typical. Hobos lurk around at times, but this is standard for fast food places downtown."}
{"text":"I hate that I eat here...but at 2 am in the morning....or at 8 am before work...ARG! delicious...\n\nNOW this McDonalds gives you a very nice treat if you're coming in before during or right after clubbing....now I was here not because I went clubbing but because I had a house party got pretty drunk and wanted food.  I went to the bathroom and SURPRISE two girls doing cocaine....hmmm....\" bah bah bah bah bah they're loving it\".\n\nI came here another time and AGAIN ladies doing cocaine! Man very classy!  Anyways....this mcdonalds always screws up the order and gives you the wrong thing or forgets, but hey its Mcdonalds really cant ask for much!\n\nThere's also a lot of homeless people who sleep here"}
{"text":"During the boxing day madness, my friend suggested to just walk up to this McDonalds, since we were guarantee it wouldn't be crowded. And that was the case. The lineup was very reasonable, yet the service was so slow. I also had a very small order, but it still took 15 minutes for them to get my order. The snack wrap was cold and they put too much sugar and cream in my coffee when I asked for a regular coffee.\n\nNot the best McDonalds. Never planning to come by again. There's other fast food chains around to have."}
{"text":"$2.25 for a sundae with 2 toppings. My fave are fudge and strawberry. One on top and one on bottom.\n\nFree WiFi, convenient location (near Wellesley subway station), and they have everything I like. What's to not like. Oh, except it's McDonald's and I always regret eating the food. Greasy and heavy!"}
{"text":"Terrible service in the drive thru today. Had to sit in line for 15 mins, to just get sodas, then were told need to pull up and wait...."}
{"text":"Me and my family went to McDonald's today and the service was super slow. I had to wait half an hour to get a happy meal for my kid. Then when they had finally gave us our food we left. And on the way out we saw a rat running out of the restaurant behind us."}
{"text":"I come here multiple times a week and get an iced coffee. The ladies in the morning are fantastic!\n\nQuick, friendly service every time. The coffee is always made perfect and they are always happy to see me, one lady even knows my name. Great job!"}
{"text":"Just popped in for a quick potty break and a snack to find that this sleepy little place is too dirty for this girl to eat!! The bathrooms so need some attention badly!! However that situation can happen during your busy time of day..... However it not busy now and the place is a mess- trash cans flowing over, dinning room messy and to boot the manager (either shift/ main manger) was just not in the mood to run the register today!! While waiting for service it have me time to observe the place and to make the deduction to walk!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! They get one star because zero isn't an option.  I used to get breakfast here before work since I leave town at around 5am. Last week I stopped in and ordered breakfast then payed for my food at the first window. I then pulled up to second window and never saw anyone again!! I waited almost 15 minutes without seeing anyone at the front counter or my food! The service was terrible. I honked a few times then just gave up and left. Then three other times in the past 2 weeks I decided I'll just get coffee cause it's fast right?! Wrong.... The wait on a coffee one time was 5 minutes at the window once they finally took your order.  Two other times nobody even bothered to answer the drive thru speaker. Out of all these instances the morning manager was on duty cause she is an easily recognized oriental women. They need better management here before I'll ever give them another dime!"}
{"text":"Went to get a frappe and got the wrong one and told the Manger and she took the whip cream off and put new on and tried to give it to me and I said I wanted a new one she said she was not making one very bad customer service  I wish I could give no stars"}
{"text":"Unorganized inconsistent timely rude lack of training. I've been there several times, you never know what kind of experience you're going to get. In short I hate this place compared to any other McDonald's"}
{"text":"Horrible. Service is way too slow for a \"fast\" food joint. This place makes me wonder if the cow was still grazing in the field and if the potatoes have yet to be grown. Not to mention the crumbs on top of every single table in there, ice machine out of ice, restrooms look like they haven't been cleaned in a week, and the food is mediocre at best. Not that I was expecting fine dining or anything, but at least edible food please."}
{"text":"First of all I have to say I hate all McDonalds so this might be a bit biased. My daughter was really hungry and wanted some chicken nuggets (yes, I disapprove of chicken nuggets in all shapes and forms but decided once in a while is OK). We ate inside. When we opened the door I noticed it was almost as hot inside as it was outside. It was so hot in there!! Do they not have air conditioning? I know McDonalds is low budget but that is ridiculous! \n\nNo one was speaking English behind the counter and when that happens I don't know why but I always feel like they are talking about me because I can't understand them. My Spanish is very limited. \n\nAfter my daughter finished her meal we went up to get her a snack McFlurry. It is advertised for $1.00 but in the small print it says with a meal. Since we had purchased two meal I thought that qualified but that's not the case. You have to order it when you order your meal. Really? Why is that? What kind of Nazi made that rule and then sticks to it? Why would you order it with the meal just to have it sit there and melt in the stifling hot smelly eating area? Makes no sense. This place is just stupid with stupid people running it. My daughter was really looking forward to the McFlurry but after we were told we would have to pay full price even she understood why I almost flipped them off then walked out the door."}
{"text":"I don't have high expectation for McDonald's. All I know is I suppose to get acceptable fast food and fast service..........\n\nWalked in wanting to get a treat after having lunch next door and the place was crazily busy. The reason was not because this McDonald's is the coolest place to be, the staff here were just so disorganized and slow...\n\nOur Strawberry Sundae, Soft Serve Cone and Iced Coffee took forever to be ready! Not like those are custom orders or need to be cook!!\n\nLines just kept getting longer and longer........ I just want my ice cream!!\n\nSadly my ice cream was meh as the cone tasted stale............ FAIL!!\n\nThe only good about this location is the dinner area opens 24 hours! Maybe I will be back  if I am drunk, hungry and desperate........"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast in the morning. It wasn't busy so I was served fairly quickly. The staff had their mcdonalds smiles on, which was cute. They all seem pretty happy, but then again, it's just the start of the day!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a big McDonald's fan but it is sometimes the cheapest and most familiar choice around for a quick bite to eat. The increase in prices such as previous value menu items makes me buy their food less. I have mixed experiences at this location, depending on the time. Morning seems like a good time for a quick order and lunch time should be avoided because of line ups. Ordering late at night felt slow as well with fewer staff. Sometimes the coffee tasted watered down or somehow different than what I'm used to compared to other locations. I know that it has been revamped but the inside atmosphere usually feels dead and this place looks small although I never dine in anyway at this location.\n\nRecently there was one young employee in particular at this location who enhances the whole McDonald's experience. I could not remember if his name was Andre or something else. If you have the privilege of ordering during his shift, he will definitely brighten up your day and make this location come to life. I was very impressed with his professionalism, charisma and customer service skills. He should definitely be a mentor to other staff."}
{"text":"Nothing gets an office more pumped than a large order of McDonald's. We placed a large order here for 50 burgers (25 jr chickens and 25 mcdoubles) with a couple of trays of fries and these guys had our order ready to pick up right on time. They even threw in a free McDonald's apron upon request."}
{"text":"Walked in and it was clean! The staff had the smiles and were very nice.   \n The food came very fast and was = to the other place and when I worked at McDonald's long time ago!   The person who served me was very helpful in helping me pick my lunch.   \nWent to lobby after getting my food the first table was not clean and I found a much comfortable sit and was happy!  \n\nI would come back if I need a meal or drink and was in the area."}
{"text":"Great place to visit if you are on the go. Service was quick and the food was delicious. The play place is extremely tiny but suits most people."}
{"text":"This location has been a mccafe for a year or so but the counter has under gone another chance as it does now have the express kiosk machine for ordering. Service is quicker then i noticee in past and it pretty clean.\n\nThis is why my rating will go up."}
{"text":"I work very close and I'm here probably three times a week. They screw up at least every third order. My last two haven't been correct. They never offer to make it right they just give me the correct order. Never mind the fact that I have to leave work to come back and get a correct order.\n\nAside from that,  two of the girls that work the registers almost always have an attitude. Kind of like we should be grateful that they are taking time out of her important day to take our order.\n\nI actually am eating it right now and my jalapeno burger ( which I ordered without ranch) doesnt have ranch. But they also left off the jalapeno chips. And the McWrap I ordered has burnt chicken in it."}
{"text":"I myself am annoyed at this McDonalds because they will let you sit at that damn speaker without saying a word for 10 min! Instead of saying (we will be with you in a moment ) NO THEY LET U SIT THERE! My husband gets so angry he starts beeping the horn which I told him that don't help lol I told the cashier on the speaker she could had told me to hold on so I know it least someone is there and is going to help me! She replied back so rude do you want to order or not! It was a big black lady, I don't know her name! She was still rude all the way through!  I'm telling you that McDonalds drive thru is so slow 20 min just to wait for someone to answer u at the speaker is pathetic! Bad customer service ! No stars only good thing is the biscuits are sometimes good lol so 1 star for good tasty biscuits!!!! Oh and I do not like that New late night menu u can't order everything on the menu! It m"}
{"text":"This mcdonalds is AWFUL the people working there are rude as hell.  The lady rung me up for a salad that I didn't ask for and rudely slammed the window when I asked for her to refund me.  I was very polite about it. I've worked fast food,  it's NOT THAT HARD!"}
{"text":"This is the most disappointing McDonald's around. Went threw the drive thru and there wasn't even a long wait. Order my pancakes and OJ and head to the window to pay. The lady who forgot to greet me and stuck her hand basically in my face to take my exact change, then slammed the window shut with more humpf then needed.  Never said a word. Okay head to window two, she was at least more friendly, how ever she hurried me along. I get to work all excited that I made to work with breakfast only to be disappointed that there was no napkins, plastic wear or syrup! No syrup for my pancakes. :( I was really sad. Bad service and then dry pancakes. And it is literally always like this. I think they need a visit from corporate as a secret shopper. \n\nThere is a much better location at the exits before and after this one. Buyer beware! And also be annoying and take that extra second to check your bag for accuracy. More annoyed at myself for allowing her to make me feel bad for not hurrying away."}

No, I do not want that, I want two cheeseburgers and a medium coffee, black. Well, do you want an apple pie for only a dollar more?\n\nDang, only a dollar more? I was so close to taking the bait. But no, I want what I ordered! Wow, we are suckers. He almost had me. Now I can't get that dolla apple pie outta my mind, and I kinda do want to try the McLebronwhich."}

{"text":"I figured this being a new mcdonalds there would be positive attitudes with great customer service, but I soon realized these are the same unprofessional ppl that just moved down the st.\n\n I ordered a fudge sunday, cheeseburger and a small fry in the drive thur. Pulled forward paid and proceed to pick up window. At the window a girl sticks her head out the window and gets close 2 my car and says did u have the hot fudge sundae??\nI said yes. She \"asks\" me if I would like a shake or a moca instead because they need to fill the machine and it would take 20 minutes.\n\n I shook my head and said no thank you. I didnt tell her but, I'm tryin to watch my calorie intake. A shake has more calories than a fudge sundae. I just said I want my money for the sundae if u cant make it.\nShe says \"u have to go back around and tell the guy at the pay window.\" She again asked \"you don't want a chocolate or vanilla shake\"?? I shook my head. And she proceed to say again \" well you have to go back around and tell him at the pay window\"\n I said y do I have to go back around?? Y don't u go and tell him? She touched a button on her headset and started callin the guys name.  Got frustrated when he didnt answer. Slammed the window and left. \n\nFinally, a manager asked me if I was the one that wanted the refund for the sundae. I said yes and I don't kno y that girl was so mad. I just didnt want a shake. She didnt apologize just said yea I dont kno. \n\nSo I got my money and then the manager says was that everything. I said the rest of my food! She goes back to ask them and comes back sayin I guess they dont kno what u ordered. \n\nLike seriously!!! I just said give me all my money back. I figure the girl that was mad I didnt get a shake just deleted my whole order. But clearly when I pulled up at the window she only wanted to talk about the sundae she didnt have. \n\nExtremely bad customer service. If a customer doesnt want a replace then just give them there money. Don't try and get mad because they don't want a replacement item. I came there mainly for the sundae!"}

{"text":"If I could I would give zero. I came here a few times just to see if they were having a bad day...... Nasty nasty nasty! I never worked for them but I know when tea has been sitting there and not changed. Oh so many times. Kfc did this to me as well as jack in the box. It should not smell like rotten eggs! And they always get the orders mixed up. They even skipped me in line as I watched 3 cars go in the other lane. I honestly think they should just change the management at this location. I've been coming here for the last year but nothing has changed. I went there for the last time. So disgusting!"}
{"text":"Never have i ever had bad experiences like this at a McDonald's. Herman or what ever his names is at the drive thru gave me his attitude like he dont like his job.

{"text":"I'm writing this for therapeutic reasons, I think. And the second star is for one guy at the counter...read on. For my Northern friends, this McD is in North Carolina, where I recently went for work. With some poor planning on my part, I was wearing a long sleeve shirt on a day that was headed over 90 degrees. First 90+ day for me. Ooops. \n\nI was headed to the McD's to meet a couple people. When I arrived the doors were propped open. Uh oooh. Sure enough, the air conditioning was on the blitz. Blah. But I had no choice - people were headed there to meet me so I had to go in. \n\nOne step inside and squish squish squish. Ahhhh...their soda fountain had sprung a leak and had covered most of the front of the store. Nothing like squishy sticky pop on the floor - infused with extreme humidity and that 90 degree heat. Baaaaaahhhhh!!!!! Did I mention my long sleeve shirt? Oh, and with the leaky soda fountains there were no drinks available from the fountain. Insert evil laugh heard overhead here. \n\nSomewhat disoriented by the dominating sticky smelly Orange Drink that was both underfoot and in the air I heard the gentle words from a cashier, \"Welcome to McDonalds. Can I help you?\" Really, I was stunned at his effort to sound happy. It was amazing how he tried to make his attitude overcome Agent Orange. I was thrown off completely by him.\n\nRemarkably, this place served bottled water. Yes, please. My people arrived and we got through it. Too quick, but what needed to get done got done. \n\nOut the door I went, glad to be out of the Orange Sauna and looking to jack up the AC in my car as quickly as possible. \n\nNaturally, during my short meeting the McDonald's fix-it guy showed up and, of course, he had blocked in my car..."}

{"text":"Wasn't greeted when I entered. At all. Waited ten minutes after I ordered to get asked what are you waiting on, place wasn't even that busy. Then I had to mention I was waiting on my stuff again and waited five more minutes. She slid the bag on the counter and said here you go. No eye contact. Fries tasted awful and so did my burger. What a waste."}
{"text":"I love how this McDonald's has a face to face ordering.  No speaker and it reduces the errors.  They provided us quick and friendly service.  The only negative that it was hard to find from the highway and hard to get out."}
{"text":"Like McDonald's anywhere the food stinks,But sometimes I get it anyway close to Highway,one time I went in the restaurant and I could hear (What I thought was the manager) Yelling at his employees! Bad move... Ruined my experience,Will use drive thru (If I bother to come again)"}
{"text":"Whoa face to face ordering - nicccccee!! I've never had that at McDonalds before!\n\nAnyways.. they ran out of medium fries containers so we got two large fries - awesome time! \n\nSuper grimey dirty bathrooms though - make sure you hover mode!!!"}
{"text":"Ok...I get it.  It's fast food and so the service and food will be mediocre at BEST.  I have no problem with that and will still take my kids because anything that comes with a toy and offers a playground is fun.  So I don't care that my food is messed up half the time and the employees look at me like I'm pain when I ask them to correct my order....no big deal.  However, yesterday I took my kids to the indoor playhouse and what do I see skimmy across the floor in broad daylight...a nice, furry RAT!!  Yeah....I think I'll buy my kids that swing-set and get a deep fryer."}
{"text":"I travel and so I eat out a lot. That said, This McDonalds is nasty. Face to face ordering is ridiculous and lazy, I figure the intercom broke and they were too cheap to fix it, but I could be wrong. I pulled up, made the order and sat there, had to ask the lady what to do next, she never said to pull forward. I got my two hamburgers, they both had hard stale buns, one had no ketchup or mustard. They both looked old and stale. I ate one and got a stomach ache and watery mouth afterward. I did not eat the other one. When I go back by that restaurant I will go in and get my Money back. They should be ashamed to serve old food like that. I should have gone to Chic filet next door, it was packed and had a long line, the Mcdonalds had no business and no line, that should have been a sign not to eat there."}
{"text":"Incompetent workers that I cannot believe want a raise for doing such a piss poor job. I knew I should've checked my very simple when the simple worker took it. Hijack SOB can't tell their asses from a hole in the ground. Will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm reviewing McDonald's. \n For a McDonald's, this particular one is very good and clean. They tried a new \"face to face\" ordering system, so they have no speaker to yell into at the drive thru. You must speak to one of their very pleasant employees. They are fast and always get the orders correct. \n\nI will agree that the parking lot and drive-thru lane planning is very poor...but if you are craving one of their tasty burgers and fries or the new 20 piece nuggets for $4.99 then you could survive the parking situation."}
{"text":"Always have terrible service with stupid, idiotic staff.  The only reason they get my business once in a while is to bring my six-year-old to the Playplace.  Most McDonald's suck, but this one is truly one of the worst."}
{"text":"Worst drive thru! If you are in a time crunch don't bother! Slowest I have ever been in. Spent 12 min in line just for a coffee. Don't know why I come back to this location."}
{"text":"They just got a face lift.  The place looks good and 2 drive thurs lanes now.  Still the same good and level of service."}
{"text":"Went there for a to-go order for work about a month or so ago, so I had a large order... There was a guy named David cleaning the lobby, and he could see I was struggling b/c I had a lot to carry.  Sometimes I wish I could spontaneously grow a third arm, but alas, I cannot.  He was very prompt in asking if I needed help with my drinks and I was so grateful for his help!  I never expect to get immediate and helpful service from the fast-food industry, but I was so impressed that I immediately called corporate to let them know they have an employee that went above and beyond."}
{"text":"Awful!  Small gnats were flying all over.  The floors were sticky and the tables weren't wiped clean.   Gross.  Horrible, slow service.  One person working the front end and drive through.  I asked for a toddler toy with the kids meal and was told to wait.  5 minutes later, she still hadn't even looked for the toy.  Finally she said she didn't know where they were to come back another time!  I don't think I'll be going back to that place anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review while I'm waiting on my order... First I had a large order as I was buying breakfast for my coworkers... I tried to call the order in to expedite my wait... 3 phone calls and nobody answered. So I decided to go inside and not hold up the drive thru. I asked for 14 sausage egg mc muffins and the cashier looked at me like she didn't know what I ordered... Then she told me my total was $50.... The sausage egg mc muffins are their biggest deal and she over charged me $20... It's not super busy but the lack of training from management in this place is horrible. And the attitude from employees here makes me want to drive to a further location. Nobody smiling or anything. Won't be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"Each time I've gone there I have waited at least 20 minutes in the fast food lane. Only to have cold food!!! Will never return. \n\nUnacceptable."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this McDonald's hasn't shut down. Does anyone know how to make a Vanilla McFlurry with strawberry toppings?!?! Can anyone count back change!?!?! Hm... Can anyone pay attention and do their job instead of giggling in the microphone where people can here you!?!? Not this place!!! Wow society has definitely downgraded in educating teens these days. Oh and that stereotype about low life's working at McDonald's, NEWS FLASH!, it's not a stereotype if it's true!"}
{"text":"Worst MDs I have ever been to.  We visit many MDs with our grandson I will never come to this one ever again. Dirty tables, slow service, dirty drink Station, tv blaring, music going at the  same time and they got my order wrong. They forgot my French fries. My order was only a mighty kids meal, a number 10 and a chicken wrap."}
{"text":"Got real good food at this location on my last visit, but like most Mcdonalds you'll get great service half the time. The other half, they're getting orders wrong, not wearing name tagS, and have slow delivery. I usually avoid this location though because it deals with high volumes of customers."}
{"text":"Awful service and such a slow drive thru. \nNot coming back.\n\nOrdered a smoothie and they let me order, pay, and wait at the other window until they figured out they don't have any... \nI sat at the drive thru window several minutes before someone even opened it and acknowledged me and there was a line behind me! \nThey definitely don't move with much purpose."}
{"text":"Horrible service for being a fast food chain. Horrible drive thru for late night eating. I'd rather go to the McDonalds on 99th and lower buckeye. Never want to come back here. Ever!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 Big Macs one no cheese, the one with cheese extra sauce and 2 large fries. While driving up through the drive thru I see a sign 2 Big Macs, 20 chicken nuggets, 2 medium fries for 12.99.. I'm thinking hell ya ill eat my share of 20 chicken nuggets for pretty much the same price. \n\nMY mistake. Should of never switched my order at the drive thru. I knew it would make it too complicated. I just think they should be like hey do you want to get the 20 chicken nuggets for practically free? Instead of me realizing the deal and bringing it up to make it complicated. Go to pay $18? That can't be right.. Looking at receipt 2 large frys separate.. Whatever not even worth it at this point for a refund I'll just take the fries\n\nGet to the second window. A woman asking me about the burgers if I ordered the one just with mayo, I tell her that is not mine. And tell her what I ordered.. By the confused look on her face walking away I knew I was going to have to go inside.. Just watching through the window everyone's running around with a chicken with its head cut off.\n\nI get a Big Mac no sauce add mayo, a Big Mac no onion, 20 chicken nuggets, 2 medium fries and and hot and spicy.\n\nGo inside front counter girl is nice asks what happen while trying to explain what i needed correct the manager walks up and sighs at me, half listening to what needed to be corrected takes my bag and throws it on the floor. Tells the cook the wrong thing, so I correct her and another employee let the cook know what to make. \n\nYoung girl walks in missing her hot and spicy. I laugh and say it's probably the one I got and tell her to check her burgers. She came back in with them.. So their order was wrong.\n\nWith the manager complaining about how she doesn't want to be there and complaining she doesn't know why it's busy, my correct order finally comes up, another cashier refunds me for my over charge of fries. \n\nThe manager takes my box and kinda just tosses it on the counter, so I look at the original front counter girl wondering if that's mine or what.. and she checks it and hands it over apologetically.\n\n1. You think you would be happy to be busy because it guarantees you not only hours but a job.\n\n2. Pretty sad the only person to apologize was the young teenage girl working the front counter who didn't even take, bag, or hand out my order.\n\n3. Just upset they check my order with me in the drive thru, I specifically tell them that the Big Mac no mac sauce add mayo wasn't mine and they knowingly knew it wasn't what I ordered and tried to pass it off to me anyways.\n\nMcDonald's find a manager who can actually manage and wants to be there / end rant"}
{"text":"This place is bullshit.   I've been here 3 times in the past year. Each time I've waited minimum 20-30 minutes.  This place sucks"}
{"text":"this McDonald's is one of the busiest ones in the valley.  Service & Cleanliness can be 100% spot on... And then they get hit with a zillion kids and/or movie goers.  In 30 minutes the place looks like it's gone to hell in a hand basket.   So one minute service is just peachy, another and they don't seem to have enough employees.. But there will be lines out of the double laned drive up  window and crowds around the counter...  As a regular there, they do an admirable job but will always have nay sayers at this and similar locations... of any fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"This location sucks! They made us wait for 10 minutes for 2 dollar burgers. They charged us extra for 3 containers of sweet chili sauce, and the employee had an overall negative attitude. I'm gonna avoid this location in the future and go to the McDonald's at Dysart & I-10."}
{"text":"dirty, no play place, and full of weirdos cussing on their cell phones.  Pretty much the last place I want to bring my kids."}
{"text":"Dirty, tables not clean. No mirror in bathroom.  Very surprised. Usually the best place to stop for clean facilities"}
{"text":"I went to the drive thru tonight and not only did they not have the toy advertised(Shopkins-the ONLY reason we went!) but they didn't give me the sauce for the nuggets & the Coke we got was either flat or mixed with another flavor - Yuck!! So I tried calling twice and was hung up on BOTH times! The least they could have done was answer so I could speak with a manager. Terrible service and not the first time this has happened at this location."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru and was sitting in line for about 10 minutes. Instead of sweet tea I got regular iced tea, the ice in my coke was melted, chicken nuggets were overcooked and my fries were cold. One of the worst McDonald's I've ever been to."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I'm at the drive thru as I write this. A car in front of me just left without any food and I believe he payed at the first window. I keep coming here about every three minutes months hoping they've improved their service. They haven't. Slow drive thru and shitty workers. I love McDonald's and this one needs a new crew. I'll be calling corporate in hopes of improvement.\nAnd a shitty \"I'm sorry for the wait.\""}

{"text":"No air conditioning or the temperature is set at 80. WiFi is terrible and overall service is average. Bathroom usually dirty. Reverting back to Mcdonalds of 1990s. Not just this location but others as well."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here on my way from Akron back to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. Cool little McDonald's - very nice inside. Ordered a Filet-O-Fish sandwich and a small Diet Coke.\n\nGood, hot food. Clean location!"}
{"text":"What a strange location. The tiniest parking lot I have ever seen. The tiniest ladies restroom I have ever seen. All I got was a senior Coke to go, and it might have had 4 ice cubes in it. The entrance/exit doors look like they haven't been painted since 1975.  Maybe it's time to tear the building down and start over, although the lot probably is too small for one of today's McDonalds."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Mccy Dee's I've ever been to. \n\nThey never change their fry oil so fries are either brown or stale.\n\nI don't even order a shake any more because they either wouldn't put enough flavor in it or they wouldn't  mix it up.\n\nIf there was some fast food competition in the Home of Mayor Big Jerry, then maybe they would be forced to step up their game a little.\n\nAs it is they are the only game in town and it shows."}
{"text":"Food is typical McDonald's but this place is a homeless shelter. I think the entire homeless population of Central Phoenix use the bathrooms here.  As to the person that complained about not being versed is dealing with the lgbdkiytre population, what the fuck are you talking about.  Is there a special way to deal with you? Get over it already, there's nothing special you.  You have issues."}
{"text":"My new theory is that McDonald's is developing animatronic workers to replace humans but hasn't gotten the artificial intelligence module to work right.\n\nThe single star is not for serving McDonald's food, as if you're considering eating here, you've already signed on for that, know what to expect, and are mostly interested in the fries anyway.\n\nThe single star is because Waiting for Godot makes logical forward progress faster than the staff here. Any deviation from the program baffles them.\n\nFor instance, the corporate overlords added a value menu item to compete directly with Burger King's bacon double cheeseburger. Hint: when a customer orders it with the BK name, this is a GOOD thing. It means the strategy is working. Do not go all blue-screen-of-death until the customer comes up with the exact Mickey Dee's trademarked name. Then, when asked what's on it, don't require multiple reboots to deal with the question.\n\nMost important, when you realize you have put a to-go order on a tray instead of in a bag, PUT IT IN A BAG and deliver it to the customer. Do not decide this is too complex to cope with and leave it sit back in the food prep area until the customer gets tired of waiting and asks about it. When asked, do not go all eye-rolling. It is your JOB to deliver people's orders correctly and in a timely manner. You screwed up. Say \"I'm so sorry\" (yes, we both know you have no emotion module, but fake it) and fix it.\n\nAdditionally, do not fill the unsweet tea dispenser with sweet tea. I like McDonald's sweet tea, but I like it when I have poured myself sweet tea, not when I deliberately avoided it because there'd be plenty of sugar in my (now lukewarm) pie.\n\nThe new restaurant design is impressive, in the manner of late 1990s federal courthouses, and this one has a McCaf√©. However, it's possible that it's all some sort of perverse performance art or social experiment, as this location is not listed on McDonald's official site."}
{"text":"I've been to this McDonalds multiple times and have almost always been disappointed. Gonna use tonight's story as an example:\n\nI see these sketchy characters hanging out outside the McD's parking lot area plus there's a big diesel blocking most of the parking so I go through the drive thru. I wait for 5 minutes with cars pilling up behind me for someone to take my order. Eventually I just drive up to the first window. The guy at that window doesn't take my order, just points and mouths to go to the next window...okay.\n\nNext window, dude stops me from talking when I pull up to the window to take someone else's order. I get you have to be efficient but wtf you didn't take my order at the window, had me wait, then take someone else's order first? K.\n\nThen he takes my order. I say quarter pounder with cheese and medium fry. I have my monopoly coupon for the sandwich and my debit card out for the fries. He asks me if that's it, I say yes the quarter pounder with cheese and the medium fry. He ignores my repetition and hands me a receipt for the sandwich only.\n\nAt this point I'm like whatever no fries because he clearly doesn't care. I get my burger 5 minutes later and say thank you and he doesn't say anything, didn't even have any eye contact the entire time so he looks down and closes the window.\n\nCome here if you're not loving it and if you want order fails but are desperate for a Quarter Pounder because you're broke."}
{"text":"I think they took all the workers from other McDonalds that were going to be fired and put them all here. The 3 times I went there they screwed up my order.  They can't even make a simple coffee.  Never again"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a fast food fan, but this has become my go-to pit stop when I drive out to this part of town for work. The strip mall is very \"sketchy\" but the restaurant itself is always clean and relatively quiet (busy, but no excessive shouting or commotion).  The employees are friendly, polite, and fast; I've never seen the line to order get longer than 2 customers. The restroom is extremely clean (customers only) and spacious. \n\nI only ever get simple orders, like water bottles or coffees, so I can't vouch for the food, but the customer service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Its pretty lame.. The two times I've gotten breakfast from here on my court dates, they mess up the order. I asked for 2 bacon mcgriddles, which is about the only thing I like from McDonald's. I was on my way to court, and I realized they gave me 2 lil sausage biscuits! I checked my receipt, and they charged for the mcgriddles! Its like, really dude? Get your damn orders straight... Man, I was excited when I saw all this construction on 7th Ave n Indian school, right where I live. Turns out all along they were making a McDonald's.. They're taking over the world :("}
{"text":"I know this is another typical McDonald's, but I really had no complaints. Maybe it's because the 2 times I've come here, it has been very late at night and not during peak hours or anything, but I really had no issues with my food. In fact, the hash browns (yes, I requested hash browns for my midnight munchies), were very fresh. Even the employees were nice to me. No issues here!"}
{"text":"Bogo McMuffin after completing a questionnaire online.\n\nI like the ambiance, it feels like mid-century style--clean, neat, comfortable and not industrialized.\n\nThe manager was at the door when I arrived and he both greeted me pleasantly and held the door for me.\n\nMy cashier greeted me pleasantly, answered my questions, took my order (including the special requests), and wished me a good day.\n\nMy order was accurate and tasted good. Besides, it was VALUE priced (bogo).\n\nMy experience (for fast food/MickyDs) was very much 5 star."}
{"text":"If there were a lower rating, I'd post it. Food=terrible Service=terrible \nGeneral Rating= something lower than 1 star\n\nConvenience is the only factor keeping fast food chains like this alive. The awful food produced, and equally terrible service at any location, are only part of the reason why I do not go to drive thru. I've seen the videos on \"pink slime\" and all videos alike about McDonald's, but that's just a media ploy. I could rant on but I think you get the point. If you like living, change your diet and deal with a grumbly stomach rather than put up with the stress and disappointment of the \"drive-thru\" world. Absolutely have lost faith"}
{"text":"How can you strike and expect $15 an hour when you can't even get an order correct on a slow night when I'm THE ONLY car in he drive thru?  Simple order. Not complicated. You even repeated it back to me and it printed out on my receipt, yet you missed ALL the sauces that were printed on the receipt and half the sandwiches! And then,, you lied to my face and told me that everything was in the bag after I asked. Bullshit."}
{"text":"This McDonalds is a small express store compared to some of the larger ones out there.  Today when i walked in i must commend the staff for putting out those orders so quickly.  I was very impressed with their efficiency, but this is McDonalds we are talking about here, nothing is what it seems.  So after making it during the evening rush to the cash register in record time and getting my meal just as fast, i realized they had all hands on deck in the kitchen and nobody is minding the front of the house. People loitering is one thing, but garbage on the floor and no clean tables?  Yup no clean tables.\nWent to get a napkin and a vinegar pack to clean it myself but no vinegar and the napkins were pushed into the dispenser so far i could only get one single napkin.  \nOK, its on a tray, i will live, i have been in worse places so i sat down and with the first french fry in my mouth i could taste the crusting of salt on these fries, so excessive i think I'm going to retain water like a pregnant woman for the next week, and I'm all manly man so that should NEVER happen.  Just to get though those fries i slurped constantly on my ice tea which was obviously watered down because its time to change the syrup canister for the drink dispenser.  OK, I know i can do this, the quarter pounder wont disappoint me.  WRONG!\nMcDumbasses better kiss and make up with Heinz and get me some real ketchup not that cut rate crimson swill you put on my burger.  \nKitchen staff you are very efficient, i will admit that, but the quality of the food was at best a 3/5 and the cleanliness of the restaurant left much to be desired even if it was a rush, you were at least one man down and thats why your front end score is 1/5 giving you an overall score of 2.  My thoughts is all of these things were quality control issues related to the manager, the kids on shift were amazing at getting down to business so please please please get my breakfast right tomorrow.  I rarely eat there any other time than breakfast so dont mess that up too"}
{"text":"This is a small location in a busy mall. It is about as clean as a playplace and the food quality is subpar. If your really in a hurry then it will serve your needs but I cannot recommend eating in"}
{"text":"I might have known when there were no cars outside. I ordered an Egg McMuffin and asked if there were any choices besides processed cheese. \"No\" said Sandeep.  \"Then may I have one with no cheese please?\" it arrives. it has a slice of processed cheese. I could see it through the wrapper.  I said \"This one has cheese,\" She turned around and made another sans cheese.. \"So you don't want cheddar?\" she asked.  I said \"I thought there were no other choices.\" Cheddar isn't pocessed, or they can't call it cheddar as I understand it.\" \"They are all processed\" she said.  Maybe I've been out of the country too long. When I started to eat the second Egg Mcmuffin, it was thinly sliced, barely there regular bacon, not the Canadian bacon I was accustomed to, which I could have dealt with, but after the second bite I realized, it was barely warm. So I returned to the counter and said to the lady, \"Sandeep, feel this, it's almost cold.\" She grabbed it from me and opened the package saying \"Aww, you've eaten half of it.\" Not sure if that's in the McDonald's employee's handbook.  I said \"Forgive me, when I left this country when you ordered an Egg McMuffin, it had back bacon or Canadian bacon, and I didn't realize I had to specify.  She then launched into a lecture about how they are two different sandwiches and I didn't say \"Canadian bacon.\"  Fine, \"Here is what I would like; An egg McMuffin with Canadian bacon, and no cheese, please. \" This is the third order now. She returned with another which, thank God was hot.  Because of her attitude I asked for the store number. The other employee told me 2500.  Well, that wasn't the store number, it was the address. The store number was 21420. When I asked the owner's name, who, in my view should know why his numbers are not what they should be, I was told \"Eric.\"  Great.  But you can fill in the survey on the back.  Over to the site I go, where the field that asks you to fill in the date won't fill in.  Others yes, that one, no.  Call the store.  Ms. Sandeep answers. Forget this store.  Forget McDonald's. They suck anyway.  I go there in a pinch after watching the movie and how the guy almost killed himself eating there.  I have done charity work with them and hung out there as a teen and loved it.  This store blows and nobody has taken dialect reduction classes so you have to say everything three times.  Avoid it like the plague. And Sandeep, if you don't like your job, quit.  Someone who appreciates it will gladly fill your rude shoes. Oh yeah, the 4th McMuffin Ms. Sandeep brought had cheese on it. Arrrrrrgggggh!!! To her credit, she did say \"Sorry,\" and replaced it But by then she knew I'd be contacting someone. \"Eric\" you need to screen your applicants better.  You paid big money for this franchise, don't let poor employees narrow your margins and wreck your place's rep."}
{"text":"It's a McDonalds....but smaller and a bit inefficient. However it makes for good late night eat for the area."}
{"text":"One of the few McDonalds locations in the core are that has a full coffee bar, this recently remodeled McDonalds is one of the nicer ones in the area. Located close to the intersection of Yonge and Charles Streets, the location is busy during weekday and weekend afternoons.  The building that houses this location use to be the former Post Office for the downtown core area during the 1900s, and now houses McDonalds and a Starbucks next door. Menu at this location is the same as other Canadian locations in Toronto.  The recently remodeled look and the presence of a latte bar adds to the positive rating I've given this location."}
{"text":"The only reason I am even reviewing this McDonald's is because I used to own a condo around here and more than once I walked in to pick something up on the way home, as this McD's is open 24/7. \n\nI find it odd, as the building itself is architecturally interesting -- really, take a closer look at the whole building next time you are walking across the street, it's a classic, yet strange mix of Victorian and Romanesque Revival architecture  -- however, once you walk in... wow. \n\nAlthough the place is not the most disgusting McD's I have ever come across, there is a certain depressing vibe about this location, ESPECIALLY at night.  \n\nYou are bound to notice a strange menagerie of normal, homeless, eccentric, possibly mentally ill customers along with overly tanned, skinny strippers from both the gym and the strip club just up and down the street.     \n\nAs far as the food, well, it's a McD. It's the same pretty much everywhere. \n\nIf you *have* to come here, like in my case --as there was nothing else open when I would swing by-- just pick up your order and go, go, go!"}
{"text":"Small and dirty, this McDonalds is clowning around.\n\nThe food is what you expect but the atmosphere is nothing special. Split in two with the front open and airy but the back is tight and stuffy.\n\nI'd rather go hungry than dine in here again."}
{"text":"Ugh! Dark, dirty, depressing. I suspect, bug-infested. A poor substitute for the cheerful space that was on Bloor Street before it was demolished to make way for (yet another) condo.\n\nI can appreciate the problems of its location and the associated clientele, but McDonald's is a place I reluctantly take my child. This place is not child-appropriate. It seems best for takeout for adults only."}

{"text":"This McDonald's is in a great downtown location, and in a funky building right next to a Starbucks sharing a similar exterior decor.\n\nThe food is fairly good, and doesn't differ much from most other McDonalds (at least judging from what I had), although the standard was perhaps a bit lower than what I usually see.\n\nThat said, despite its cool location, the cleanliness was very bad, and there was spilled drink and squashed food lying on the floor throughout the store, and there didn't seem to be any attempt from someone in the store to clean up the mess.  This unfortunately was what I remembered the most about the place."}
{"text":"Guilty as charged - yes I went to McDonalds for breakfast.  I'm really starting to like McDonald's coffee, and I've always loved their 10,000 calorie egg mcmuffin.  Something about that egg is so good!!!\n\nI usually would give McD's two stars, but this one is kind of cool in that they ask for your name.  Extra star for that and trying to make you feel appreciated."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is filthy. They don't bother to wipe the tables clean. On one occasion there was a homeless man sleeping, stretched out on the seating. Staff walked by and said nothing, nor did they bother to clean any tables while they were in the lobby. I worked at McDonalds 30 years ago. Their cleanliness standard has slipped."}
{"text":"Their food is usually pretty solid and they almost always get my order correct.  The new renovation looks really nice, but whoever designed it didn't think about how long the lines get post-clubbing and during the breakfast rush.  It is nearly impossible to get in the front door now during busy times.  I see a new renovation coming soon, because I know a lot of people don't like what they've done."}
{"text":"This establishment is a sham!!!!!!! The food.... limp. The decor... disappointing. The employees... rude and zombie-like. The experience.... not what I paid for. I sit here composing this plaintive Yelp‚Ñ¢ review, feeling lost and alone in this world. All of the esteemed values Mr. Ronald McDonald worked hard to uphold... just shattered. Expect to hear from my lawyer soon. I will be suing for emotional and psychological damages!!!!"}
{"text":"This location is ok. They screw up my order about 50% (and most of that is one guy who seems to ring in whatever he wants, the other workers are cool) of the time but are super quick to fix it. It seems like the lines are improving, never really wait too long for food. My one real complaint is the sketchy people that are there all day every day on their netbooks not consuming McDonalds products. Some of them stare at you while you eat. And I don't mean random different people every day. I mean like the exact same four people all the time, always. There has to be a better place to hang out. Thinking about taking some mall flyers and community centre cards to leave around on my next visit."}
{"text":"I usually don't bother to rate McDonald's, as all of the food is exactly the same. This restaurant, on the site of a former Wendy's, has recently been renovated to look more like a sitdown restaurant than your usual McD's. They've introduced some pillars and Restaurant Makeover colouring. The problem is the pillars make it hard to get around the restaurant and they block off the lineup, which is forced to stretch into the dining area, which is awkward and a real pain."}
{"text":"So, by now you figured out that this is McDonald 's, where they have mastered the art of making lots of money with the least amount of effort. What 's worse, is even Elite Yelpers write reviews of this place (and other McDonald 's) and feel guilty, offering up excuses and mild eruptions of self loathing. Let me be the first to say... You are forgiven!\n\nThis McDonald's is average at best. They got my order right, and while the place was not clean, it wasn't filthy either.\n\nLike all McDonald's, there is no apology or benefit received when they make you wait or waste your time with a wrong order.\n\nThere are no drink stations here. Big up charges for wanting a soda instead of coffee at breakfast. The restaurant  is also a homeless hangout with low lighting.\n\nThat being said, the service at the counter is better than some McDonald's. I admire that there are people working here who take pride in their jobs and who get up early to make service here happen."}
{"text":"I love McDonalds but this location is run by very poor operators. Every time I am in there and I had a hotel close by so I went there frequently particularly for breakfast, they screwed something up. Always check your order before leaving. And don't even think about eating inside as it is filthy. They were regularly out of routine items like butter or ice tea to name just two. No boxes for happy meals for my kid and no toy selection. Pretty embarrassing. The food was fine when they didn't mess up the order."}
{"text":"The staff try their best but the location is too small for the amount of foot traffic it gets. As other reviewers have noted after you've managed to find where the line starts your left hanging around the small serving area waiting for your order.\n\nI was here a few days ago and ordered an Angus burger, I waited around 10-15 minutes, presumably because it's a special order. I'm guessing they have a small kitchen so you'll be waiting a while."}
{"text":"I felt that I should review the best McDonald's in the hood.\n\nTo end a great night out...sometimes you just need a Big Mac and fries.\nNo matter how completed inebriated I am...\nStumbling around and completely confused...\nI may not be able to operate my wallet without help...\n\nThis 24 hour location has always been there for me.\n\nNothing like enjoying tasty calories and those crispy salty fries while the sun is rising.\n\nThank you McDonalds!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty sketchy place. There are always homeless people sitting on the steps outside begging for money as they (mostly) block the entrance. The other day there was someone with an obvious mental disease that was randomly yelling at a customer who was sitting trying to enjoy his meal. It didn't even seem to phase the staff as they did nothing to extinguish the situation."}
{"text":"Gross! This place is a dive's dive. There's always hobos hanging outside of this McDonalds. The food is stale and the place is barely clean. It's right next to a Starbucks. If you're looking for a great McDonalds, go to the one down the street, just North of Dundas and Yonge. Stay clear of this place."}
{"text":"I know, it seems silly to review a McDonald's, but not all McDonald's are alike. For example, this location on Charles and Yonge is a shit show. Just yesterday, I went to pick up a cappuccino (they are a $1 for a small right now), and the machines were not working. The weekend before, I picked up an ice coffee, and they gave me the wrong milk, and it tasted like sugar with a dash of coffee. Now, the Wellesley and Yonge location - they have never gotten it wrong. You are in and out quickly, and I have never had to ask them to fix an order."}
{"text":"This place is awful. As you walk you try to find the line up with 10-15 others waiting for food trying to find space to stand.  I try go elsewhere because they can't get their act together.  \n\nThis time when got my big order I was given a small bag to go. I asked for something bigger to add the order together in one bag. The guy in handling it left and told the cashier to do while he was taking another order. I waited and I had to ask again and I had to put the items in myself the bag was dropped on the counter.  I went to get napkins and it was empty, I should of checked for ketchup because I found out after I got nothing. \n\nLike I said this place needs someone to get their act together.\n\nBy the way the second last time I was there someone was asking others inline for money."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bathroom stop and quick bite on our way to an event in Madison.  The restaurant was clean as were (most importantly) the bathrooms.\n\nService was quick.  All we ordered was one order of 10 piece nuggets and a large coffee.  McDonald's coffee as usual was excellent and $1 for any size.  We did have to return to the counter to ask for creamers as they didn't remember to ask if we needed any.  \n\nI don't think that I have had chicken nuggets in about 10 years.  I think that they have really improved them.  All nice white meat.  They signs up all over the restaurant for the new chipolte ranch dipping sauce.  It was really those signs that sold us ordering the nuggets.  Good job McDonald's marketing department!  Though I have to say the sauce want' bad but I think that I would still prefer the hot mustard dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever experienced! Also, their credit card machine at the drive thru need to be replaced! It would not work with my 1 week old debit card! When i asked them to manually enter it they said sorry we can not do that.."}
{"text":"Food is the same all around the country, but why is there no wait line? The environment is really noisy. I don't want to go back once more."}
{"text":"I love friendly service with a smile but even more than that I love ice cream! McDonald's is McDonald's and there really is no surprise as to what they offer but I will go out of my way for this locations ice cream since it's actually ice milk. Yes, there is a difference! It's refreshing and for $0.73 you can't go wrong anytime you want a sweet treat in the summer heat!"}
{"text":"24 hr open? Really? 9:25 and wait 5 minutes and no  one. Lights on drive thru, looked closed or someone not wanting to do any work. Corporate website sales it's always open. What give?"}
{"text":"For what it's worth....the Fruit & yogurt Parfait is $1; has 160 calories with the granola; tastes pretty good and they have wi-fi here. \n\nIt's a McDonald's. I don't know what's on their menu but I've learned to appreciate this quick in and out item. Service was on point at the drive thru."}
{"text":"Worst McDonalds ever.  It stinks like body odor, alarms are always going off, it takes 20 minutes to get a cheeseburger.  Oh, and the drink area is disgusting."}
{"text":"Not able to get my annual shamrock shake fix as their shake machine is currently out of commission.  :("}
{"text":"Reduced 1 star due to terrible service. Store is not busy yet service is very slow. They were out of multiple items. Didn't bother to make more."}
{"text":"Extremely slow drive thru I've ever been to\nThis should be their priority to fix as it's all over their reviews"}
{"text":"Literally the slowest service we have ever experienced!!!\nOver 10 mins in the drive thru waiting for our 2 small cappuccinos!!! OMG I feel I lost 10 years of my life with this one!!"}
{"text":"Ok so the service is slow as ever and now not only the play place is dirty but even the outside looks like a New York subway station from the 80's \n\nThis place is literally the worst McDonald's in the world. I haven't been to all them all but I can't imagine there being a worst McDonald's than this one. You can not possibly mess up more orders and be any slower than these guys. Even if you tried. \nAnd when you bring it to their attention they give you attitude and say sorry as they've already turned around and began to walk away. \nThey also always blame on them being short staff while you see 10 people jus walking around in the back. That my friend is poor management not short staff."}
{"text":"This is the second time I didn't get a full Big Mac at this restaurant. First time no meat patties on my sandwich. Second time no cheese on my Big Mac.\n\nDRNIMGD"}
{"text":"I've hit more McyD's in the past week than in my entire life combined! While on a road trip from San Diego to Flagstaff I found McDonald's $.99 Diet Coke to be my best companion! \n\nThe curb-appeal was impressive and the dual drive through was appreciated. I placed my order, \"Diet Coke please\" and when the kind drive-through attendance asked if I wanted to add an egg white McMuffin I gladly obliged. \n\nThe drive through was quick and friendly. I was pleasantly surprised the egg white McMuffin was only $2 whereas in San Diego it's over $4! \n\nI've been impressed with the service, cost and speed I've received with McDonald's while on this trip."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice. The cashiers are friendly, but both times I've had issues with my order. First time she couldn't seem to figure it out. Second time the order was wrong even though I confirmed a three times. I hate the video games in the play area. Besides being old, I really don't take my kid out in order for them to play video games. I'd rather they climb and play on the equipment. Lastly, I could not believe there is no changing table in the bathroom. This place is geared towards kids and should definitely be equipped!"}
{"text":"I took my boys there yesterday around 3pm to eat and play in the play place. A half an hour later, a herd of unsupervised children that my son was playing with thought it was hilarious to wipe poop on my son's back.  POOP!  Once my son showed me what happened, I immediately demanded to speak with the kids' parents; however, the 6-8 year old children let me know that they walked across the street by themselves to play.  \n\nI immediately went to the front to speak to the manager about the feces that was being flung around in the play area, but the manager just simply said \"Ok\" and walked with me to show them the poo culprits.  There wasn't a sense of urgency and I didn't get the typical customer service response of, \"I am so sorry this happened, I will take care of this immediately\" that you would expect from a manager hearing about poop in their restaurant.  I turned to address my kids and gather my things to leave, and the manager was no longer there.\n\nI did not stick around long to see how the situation was fully handled, but I feel like the manager did not respond appropriately.  At the very least, the play place should have been evacuated immediately for cleaning.  There were other families and children in there, but apparently people do not find E.Coli that big of a deal."}
{"text":"This is a 24hr McDonald's and I stopped by around 3am to grab a meal through the drive through. \n\nFirst thing the worker tells me over the intercom was that it was only cash only right now. I thought that was weird but I actually had cash on me so I started to order. I asked for a shake but was told that the ice cream machine was off which I've typically seen late at night at fast food places so that limitation didn't faze me. Then I tried to order fries and was told that they had no fries! Surprised, I asked what menu items they are actually making and was told just burgers and breakfast sandwiches but no combo meals due to \"no fries.\" After that, I couldn't believe it and didn't order anything. I drove away to another McDonald's on Olive Ave in Peoria which had fries and better service.\n\nOverall, poor service and never heard of a McDonald's that didn't have fries and was cash only. If you are going to be a 24 hour place, don't half ass it."}
{"text":"I am absolutely disgusted in the manager Erica at this location. I took my mom to go get her senior coffee that she likes to order. When we placed her order I was going to get my usual iced mocha coffee but then Erica started interrogating us about who was with me and she asked if I had two seniors with me. She then asked me if I had ID. Seriously lady you are carding me for freaking 69 cent coffee??? I will not be returning to McDonalds after this. ( THIS IS AN OLD POST BUT FOR SOME REASON IT WAS NEVER POSTED)"}
{"text":"Play place under renovation. Bad wi-fi mojo.  Service should be a little better to keep the place worth coming to."}
{"text":"Wow. Not a typical McDonald's. \n\nI stopped in this location today for a quick breakfast because I had an hour to kill before an appointment. Anyway, this is maybe the nicest McDonald's I've ever been inside.\n\nThe interior is new and there is lots of comfortable seating all over. The staff was friendly and quick. The manager even came out while I was eating and refilled coffees for everyone in the lobby. My food was fresh and hot and overall it was just a pleasure having breakfast here. If I lived closer I would definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"Service with a smile! This is our neighborhood McDonald's. I drive thru breakfast, lunch and dinner frequently. I am pleased to say that most of the time, the staff has been friendly. The only time that I felt slighted was during Monopoly season. Many McDonald's staff seem unwilling to honor the coupons with a light heart. Franchises need to give HQ feedback if these coupons are a burden on them to honor. Tonight, I am happy to say that service was fast. Our food was hot and the kids scarfed the classic Big Mac and 2 special order cheeseburgers down. No mistakes! The kids ate with smiles!"}
{"text":"Stop lying to us about your broken down ice cream machine at 10pm\nIt's ARIZONA it's hot, and we want ice cream at all times. And give us ketchup before closing your window telling us to have a nice day. Why do you guys do this? Just stop forgetting our orders, our ketchup, and everything!  only way to enjoy McDonald's is if you go inside one. Not drive thru. You know how they have two lanes to order then it merges to one, well I went to the second lane as someone was in the first lane, and so I waited for someone to say welcome to McDonald's and blah blah, and so I said hello? But nothing and then more cars kept going to the first lane while I was still at the second lane 4 cars went before me before I was able to actually order, and I was the first one there!  I only come here cause it's the closest fast food place to where I live that's open 24hrs.  All McDonald's do the same thing!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, typical for McDonald's. They lack customer service, the drive thru is extremely slow. Worst McDonald's ever, never coming back & don't recommend anyone to go there!"}
{"text":"I really wish the young kid would stop greeting me by saying: Are you ready to order. What happened to \"Welcome to McDonald's can I take your order?\"  They never answer on time. No car will be infront of you. However, you have to say hello really loud just for someone to say: Are you ready to order."}
{"text":"This review is only for the one in Rainbow and Blue Diamond of SouthWest Vegas.  I go here because it's one of the few Mcdees thats open 24hrs.  Menu and taste is the same as the other Mcdees around town.  Would have gotten one more star if they served breakfast before 5am because I went at 4:40am and they were just doing the lunch menu still. They denied me of a good warm hearty breakfast and had to settle for an unhealthy BIG MAC combo with a coke."}
{"text":"Alright so I rarely ever post reviews but I just had to after getting such a simple order wrong. I decided to stop by this McDonald's since it was on the way to my work. I just ordered a large iced mocha, a large fries and a 10pc chicken McNuggets. I paid at the first window then got my food at the second window. First off I ordered a 10pc, they gave me a 20pc thus charging me extra. Then they screwed up on my drink, I ordered a iced mocha and she handed me an iced coffee. Like what the?? Really disappointed.."}
{"text":"OK. so.  When we first moved here..... We had a bunch of friends visit and come stay at our brand new house back in 2008?  I don't remember... a while back.  But this joint was still fairly new.  We came here on the way to the airport to drop off our weekend guests at the McCarran for a quick bite to eat.  \n\n[Keep in mind that this is during the summertime]\n\nSo we go in.. and there are flies.  FLIES.  all over the place.  I'm weirded out and the employees are acting like nothings wrong.  I'm not sure what to do at this point and I've suddenly lost my appetite.  So I approach the counter and I ask... what's going on?  And the young man at the counter was at a loss and kinda giving me the \"get out of here\" look.  So, I made a judgement call and decided that we needed to get out of there.  \n\nI'm not talking about 1 or 2 flies that the auto door can bring in.  It was like walking through a wall. \n\nO_O  \n\n\nNext.... I should say that I have been back.  BUT. . .  years later and not after I put in a call to let the proper people know that there was a HUGE problem.\n\n... it's not always the cleanest either. \n\nI haven't encountered that problem since.... but, still not the first one I'd go to though it IS RIGHT there."}
{"text":"Why doesn't the manager make an effort to ensure that when people handle food, whether it is in a bag or whether they are just handing us a soda, take care of their finger nail hygiene? Does everyone know how much dirt, germs, bacteria, and feces particles exist in nails that are not groomed regularly. Disgusting. Females with long nails, shouldn't be allowed to serve food... Both men and women working in the food industry should be required to groom their nails and make sure they are scrubbed before their work shift. Disgusted, just look at people's nails working at most fast food chains."}
{"text":"I have to tell you it's been 2 years since I've been at a McDonalds and all I got was a Coffee Frap, it was gross, felt greasy in my mouth...like their food. Which I haven't eaten in probably 4 years and regretted it then. It's so gross!\nHaven't had a Shamrock Shake in years...it's that time of year and wanted to give it a shot. Used the drive thru, there was hardly a wait. Staff was pleasant but the stench of moth balls was unbearable when they opened the drive up window. Yuk! Thankfully the shake didn't taste like the smell of the store. Not really minty, it was okay, nothing special. I'm over the Shamrock shake. \nLets see how long it'll be this time till I make it to another McDonalds."}
{"text":"After being opened only a couple of days, this is the newest McDonald's to open in the Las Vegas valley. In a few days there will be another McDonald's opening a few miles west at Blue Diamond and Durango.\n\n  I just happened to have caught this McDonald's act on the way back from hiking. The Blue Diamond Road landscape seems to change every week. New to the landscape is the old familiar Golden Arches sign. After hiking for six hours I was exhausted and needed a snack.\n\n  Lately my opinion of McDonald's is that it does a better job of filling the void for a light meal, snack, Frape Mocha, or coffee if a coffee shop is not around. To temporarily hold over my appetite and enjoy a beverage besides water that I had been drinking all the day on the hike, I ordered the $1 large Coke and $1 hot & spicy.\n\n  Being a new McDonalds this location is modern and for now immacuately clean. First off it is a nice first impression when a McDonald's is not part of a gas station, like the one down the road at Blue Diamond and Rainbow. I entered through modern electric sliding doors. There were two managers, and I got a nice greeting. The workers were on top of their game. There were plenty of booths to choose from. The interior is more contemporary than McDonald Land. The McDonald Playland is nonexistent. What does exist is a chandelier and a more elegant lobby. They did not go modern to the point of some restaurants that feature the super Coke machines with a 100 plus flavors. The typical Coke flavors they had were not flat.\n\n McDonald's may not be 4 star dining. However, when I just want a snack to fill me up or a Frape Caramel; McDonald's gets the job done. \n\nThe Daniel. S Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 88."}
{"text":"ahhhhh just got home after getting drive thru at this location. i really considered turning around and going back but gave up on the thought. I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich with no mayo and a medium fry with a side of BBQ sauce. \n\nheres what i got\n\na spicy chicken sandwich with tons of mayo and a broken bun because of all the disgusting white shit everywhere. \na medium fry that was literally half full, honestly me saying it was half full was exaggerating, it was about a third full. \nand guess what no BBQ sauce BUT an open ketchup packet that got everywhere. \n\nBRAVO... BRAVO. and this is why i rarely eat fast food."}
{"text":"This is a prime location for residents of Mountains Edge sitting on such a busy corner.  The fries here are always tasteless and soggy, they are slow to move the drive through along and parking is difficult based on the building configuration.  If I feel like grabbing a #2 value meal I much rather travel to the McDonalds 4 miles North on Rainbow."}
{"text":"I am HORRIFIED!!!  I'm NEVER TAKING MY DAUGHTER TO A MCDONALD'S AGAIN!.. I ordered chicken nuggets for her and she said ow and pulled out something from her mouth and I don't even know what it is.  It's hard and white so disgusting.  She could have choked on this and just sanitary wise I am so DISGUSTED!!!"}
{"text":"This McDonald's is connected to the Terrible's convenience store/gas station and not particularly one of my favorites.\n\nIt's convenient when you're driving down Blue Diamond from the west, but I think the staff could use some training in the customer service end from the other McDonald's nearby.\n\nThe last time we ate there, we watched (and listened) as one of the staff members hollered from the dining area to the kitchen.  Apparently she was on break (and eating) and still wanted to maintain her conversation with her colleagues, so she continued it by screaming across the dining room and they, in turn, hollered back.  Very professional group here.\n\nI'm sure all the other customers enjoyed the show as well."}
{"text":"Slow unfriendly service surprisingly from a McDonald's. Food was not fresh either. Bathrooms were a dirty wreck as if in a roadside gas station. Take your business to a different McDonald's."}
{"text":"It is what it is... When I get the craving for a spicy chicken, I will stop by. Usually drive through because the inside has been messy most times I come in and there DT is pretty fast."}
{"text":"This isn't even a legitimate McDonald's... It's a gas station McDonald's!\n\nI've been to this location twice. Once to meet up a stranger off Craigslist and once to try and redeem my Big Mac LivingSocial coupon. The place is clean, but the location attracts some of the local bums in the area. The smell of urine is simply unappealing. I also tried to redeem my LivingSocial coupon. They wouldn't accept it, because they couldn't find a button on the menu for it. Lame. \n\n A little about my credentials:\nI first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. These morons take orders perfectly but don't bag up the exact order. Check your food before leaving drive-through!"}
{"text":"This location is part of a gas station and has not been updated in years. The food is alright but there are always flies flying around in the dinning room which is pretty unappetizing to say the least. You would think someone there would have noticed by now as I have seen the flies on several occasions."}
{"text":"A first for the gf and I - a visit to McDonald's !  Surprisingly, out of the blue, the gf was recovering from the flu and said she was craving McDonald's french fries.  Before i could get out the door to make a Mickie-D run the gf yells out asking for a filet of fish, \" anything else ? \" , she calls out for a chocolate shake, too.  Yep, I guess she's feeling better !\n\nSo i order:\n\nLarge Fries - $2.09\nChocolate Shake - $2.79\nFilet of Fish - $3.79\n20 piece chicken nuggets - $4.99\nDiet coke - $1.00\n\nMy first thought - dang, Mickie d's ain't all that cheap, $3.79 for a filet of fish ?!  Seems high to me.\n\nThe taste ?  Holy cow - some of the worst food we've had in a very long time !  My guess is the nuggets were sitting out for several hours - we ate 4 of them and stopped.  The fries were limpy, wimpy, limpy.  The filet of fish was ok at best.  Shake was ok.  \n\nThis is a reminder why the only reason i hit McDonald's is for a soda - best value and basically a safe bet !"}
{"text":"It sounds funny to critique a fast food chain like McDonald's, but this specific location is probably the worst. I'm not complaining about the food. It is what it is, but to always forgot an item from my order and then have an attitude about it is something I must complain about. Customer service isn't the easiest job, but smiling and being courteous shouldn't be too difficult. Probably my 3rd and last visit to this location."}
{"text":"My fries always suck and are soggy,  my filet o fish is dry and bread is never toasted, my orders are usually wrong and I'm constantly making a u turn to fix my order.  This has to be the worst location in such a nice area ... Terrible"}
{"text":"This place always gets my order wrong... Fries not cooked, no sauce for the nuggets, small fries when I ordered large, and etc... The employees don't pay attentions to the order"}
{"text":"The Drive Thru sucks. I mean the food comes out quickly. And Whether ordering inside or in your car you get it fast. A plus being you can hit the convenience store and get gas or snacks. But literally the drive thru dumps you at the entrance and exit on Rainbow blvd and its hard to get out. And if you come in the wrong way, you have to flip a u turn to get into the drive thru. To late for them to redo it now. I guess when im on that side of town, ill venture inside from now on."}
{"text":"Its a McDonald's attached to a gas station so you cant expect much. Food was ok as you cant screw that up to bad at a franchise restaurant. \n\nYou do have to put up with the horrible parking lot/ gas station traffic if you park and go in the dinning room is loud/small with tons of little kids running around (no playground for the kids and the parents seem to let them run wild)\n\nNapkins are by the register not by the the straws or the soda machine so make sure you grab a few when you pay for your meal or you will have to push your way to the front to get them afterwards. \n\nThere are other McDonalds near by and you are better off visiting one of them."}
{"text":"If the menu says burgers available until 4am then that's what it should be. I go there at 3:50 and the grills already off and cleaned is what I'm told..So, I won't be back my time is valuable and I don't appreciate you wasting it."}
{"text":"After I had to go and get my money returned I returned to them their burnt disgusting food and after speaking to Richard who is perhaps the WORSE Manager of any place ever he totally turned me off from this location. He does not know when to keep his mouth shut and he does not listen to what you say. He speaks at you not to you.  Super rude and disgusting \n\n\nThis McDonald's is the closest to my house so I give them my business instead of the McDonald's my client Owns on Rainbow.   Every time I ask for something it is a fail!   The first time I asked for my order to be made fresh not only was it not they gave me the wrong order.  My daughter and her sleep over mates begged for McDonald's so I got them some of this stuff.    Well trying to call there is futile as they never answer their phone.  We had a movie appointment and I didn't have time to get the food replaced so we chucked it headed to the movies and are overly priced popcorn and hotdogs because by that time we were all starving.  So I talk to Pan finally but not after anyone called me back after leaving a message no after feeling very put out by not getting to speak my mind to someone.  Well I let him know about my experience and he was super sweet and professional offered me everything replaced and I said listen just make sure it gets better.  You're close to my house you'd be the only one I'd visit.  Well we go there again a few weeks later and the order everything was fresh and I notice he is the one who hands my my food. Hmm ok he's on it! I was very pleased.  Well this morning I'm like you know what I deserve to be bad I go and get a chicken biscuit meal I'm country it calls to me.   Well I get home and it's burnt I can't even eat it and I don't want to go back out and get a new one.  Do you guys compensate for gas or time when messing up orders as frequently as you do??  Does Pan have to be there every time every day to make sure your quality stays consistent and good.  And it's not hard they have a routine and way of doing things so you memorize and repeat it is not hard. It's tedious yes however a impel enough to know.  So I just called there to say hey look at this I took pictures it's ridiculous.  And I'm just like ticked off that I'm going to eat my apple and my chest morning is gone.  Boo for your inconsistent service and letting product in which I received even go out of your food window or service counter.  Shame on the workers who passed this out.   I just called corporate and the lady is like I can offer you a coupon for a free meal. What do you mean for the meal I just paid for that will get tossed in the trash. I just bit he hash brown and it's so bitter and disgusting I call back this assistant manager answers I tell her about the situation and she says oh is it the hash browns ? Oh so you know and you let this slide ? Wow have pride in the work you do whether it McDonald's southwest or you're Bill Gates.  For goodness sake you are continually ripping people off as they are not getting a product that should be expected I a certain fashion anytime you go and purchase it."}
{"text":"They serve breakfast all day here which includes the sausage egg mcmuffin. They have not got any of my orders wrong staff is nice and friendly, but aren't they suppose to give you 4 sauces for the 20 piece chicken nugget? They only give me 3.. Charge 26 cents for additional sauce. Fries were always good, food hot.. No complaints"}
{"text":"This place is so unprofessional! \nThe girl at the cashier didn't even make eye contact. It's not the customers fault that the employees are unhappy. \nWill not visit this location again!"}
{"text":"Typical McDonalds food not much nutrition their breakfast is good and the service is quick in this particular McDonald's customer service is very very good I have to eat fast food this would be the one I would come to"}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's. Waited in line forever.. Finally got up to the window and they ask me to pull over to the second lane an they'll bring my food to me when it's ready. Wow I have to wait for a kids meal?! 10 mins too. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"What a joke this place is! 3 times I've been here, and 3 times I've paid for food that I never received after I have gotten home. This is the main reason fast food workers should NOT EVER get $15 an hour. NEVER WILL I RETURN TO THIS PLACE!! I would rather eat dirt before returning here."}
{"text":"This place is very hit and miss to me come on it's McDonald's not a five-star restaurant I  understand but classic whoever's working determines on quality of food or them to get your order correct"}
{"text":"Came here around 2:00 am and had the best service! Chris was amazing! Give him a raise please.\n\nFood and service was excellent. way beyond expectation.\nI will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"So I am very disappointed in the service I received. First I ordered my food and had to wait a long time. I forgot to order a drink so as I was waiting I walked up to order it. The manager I believe as he was collar button up shirt gave me the price of the drink but did not ring me up. As I was waiting for him to ring me up and take the cash from my hand. Another lady employee came over and the man blurted out to her \"You know I have to write you up right?\" They then proceeded to have an argument in front of me and forgot I was standing there to order. After a few minutes he realized I was still waiting and had a different employee ring me up. I then proceeded to wait for a while longer while you could distinctly hear them arguing in the back. I have never had this happen before and I am very disappointed. The WORST part is I got home and there is no sauces for the chicken nuggets, the happy meals didn't come with drinks and the toys were missing. My kids were completely crushed! I will be very reluctant to go to this McDonald's ever again."}
{"text":"I have NEVER EVER been this upset about the NON service I have ever received from McDonald's... I am visiting from out of town and my son and I decided to go through this particular McDonald's for a sundae on the way back to the hotel. \nWe waited in the drive thru line for well over 15 mins. WHAT a complete Cluster F---. \nThe NON service is the EXACT reason why we absolutely CANNOT think to give fast food workers $15 an hour! What a joke! \nI wish I would have taken a picture to post the image of the so called manager that came to the window to assist me! HA... Your so called management skills are lacking... She slammed the drive thru window on me when I questioned her on what was going on in the drive thru line, where you have a van spending over 5 mins. ordering and the employees fist bumping the customer and using profanity, while there are over 10 cars backed up just wanting to actually give McDonald's our money! \nWell McDonald's you have ruined it for me! I am done and I will be calling corporate to discuss the MUCH LARGER issue you have with this particular store! FRIGHTENING that this is how customers are treated! \nHard to even give it 1 star... it doesn't deserve that... keep driving and find a Carl's Jr or IN and OUT... I am sure they will value you as a customer more than these RUDE people!"}
{"text":"There was no one line around 3:30am and bought hotcakes, sausage mcmuffin with egg, hashbrown, mcnuggets and a mcdouble. Everything was stale, my mcmuffin wasn't even warm, the cheese was hard and cold, the hotcakes were overcooked and rubbery, mcnuggets hard and rubbery. Only thing edible was the hasbrown and fries. Also the lady taking the orders and making the food went out of her way to say that they were \"making it fresh\" yeah right! What a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast since we missed our breakfast meal period at our conference. I ordered a Sausage Egg McMuffin meal. It tasted delicious and not dry. They got our order correct the first time. Not a lot of seating though but we were lucky to get one."}
{"text":"As far as mcdonalds go, this one is one of the better ones. I come here a lot - 27 check ins so far! Ive never had bad service here that i can recall. The management must be doing something right! Kudos to you guys! Plus the kids LOVE the indoor play area here. Its big, accessible, and closed off so my kids arent as tempted to run off. And it has its own bathroom, WITH a changing table - hard to find in vegas. They also occasionally have special events, like ronald mcdonald visiting. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I walked in for a coffee today. I was looking a little more scrubby than normal and figured that the normal patrons and staff of McDonalds might be a little more understanding than a coffee house. I ordered a single iced coffee, paid, and waited at a table opposite the registers. At the time I was the only one there, but shortly after about 10 people got in line. I waited. And waited. And waited. No coffee? I thought that maybe they'd just needed to get their drive customers out of the way before moving on to my ticket. But people after me started receiving their food. 15 minuted after ordering a SINGLE COFFEE I waited through line and handed my receipt to the cashier. She said they must have skipped me and went to give the ladies my ticket by hand. Another 5 minutes later I had my coffee and was on my way. Sorry, McDonalds, I am not interested in waiting 20 minutes for a coffee."}
{"text":"We love to come here daily for a large Diet-Coke and a fruit parfait. The drive thru can be a bit slow at times, but they always cook their hash browns to the perfect crisp."}
{"text":"Half the time there is a line around the corner. Service is way too slow. Management needs to pay attention."}
{"text":"Stupid, stupid, stupid. You idiots can't tell the difference between a Filet and a Big Mac and yet you want $15 an hour? Not a chance. You aren't worth minimum wage. Stupid, stupid, stupid people. Never again with McDonald's. Never."}
{"text":"Came into this McDonalds for the first time and recieved by far the best customer service I've ever received at ANY McDonalds. Whatever the managers are doing here... Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"Waited in the drive thru for 10 mins if not longer, everyone was mad and honking. Got to the window no one came to the window to give us food or to let us know what was going on. Five mins later gave us the wrong order, didnt give the drink we ordered, i had to park and go inside to get the rest of my order. The crew looked like they didnt know what to do at all. All the employees acted like elmer fudd \" which way did the rabbit go\" \nI know its mcdonalds and all but the service sucked!"}
{"text":"This location is outdated and slow. Quality of food is sad. Today's visit is probably my last to this location. You can only burn me so many times before I give up. I have gotten nasty salads, a joke of a chicken sandwich and very slow service for the last time. I'm done. I noticed another review said how busy they always are. It's because they are so slow. That location could do so much more. They apparently have already alienated most of the locals."}
{"text":"The inside is kinda nasty. The drive thru sucks. I should'nt have to check my order to make sure they got it right but i always do. Come on people its not rocket science"}
{"text":"I pretty much only come here to treat my son.  So I took my son here because he loves to play in the kids playground area which is pretty neat for youngsters.  The food just isn't what I used to think when I was younger.  The fries are generally pretty good, unless you get served some cold fries which is disgusting.  I had the double quarter w/cheese + bacon.  It was pretty good, but the burgers are not served HOT like many other fast food places.  I would like to see the cheese melted to my bun from the heat.  Service was pretty much exactly what I would expect, nothing too great, but nothing to complain about either."}
{"text":"Wow. I cant believe that I haven't written a review for this place.\n\nIt's almost always busy. Morning, afternoon,night, there's cars in the drive thru.\n\nThe staff is always kind. Most fast food places looks like everyone who works there hates their lives.\n\n Sometimes the guys on the late shift dance around for you.... Real positive energy! My order has never been wrong, or incomplete here, either.\n\nIf the food isn't \"classy\" or \"healthy\" enough for you, don't eat here. I like shopping organic, and what not, but anything in little doses will not hurt you."}
{"text":"Sat night at 1am No one at any window drove to two and just want to leave... No greeting at sign been waiting in a drive through for 10 min and didn't even place an order. One car in front of me, and 4 behind me..... Idk where or what the staff is doing but this is just pathetic"}
{"text":"What can I say...... It's McDonald's so it's not gourmet or fancy just simply fast food. I went through the drive thru  and they had no intercom/speaker u had to order at the window with no menu in front of you lol. My fries were old and my fish filet had very little tarter sauce on it."}
{"text":"in line at drive thru for 11 mins. so far...4 cars in frnt of me.  service a joke...12 min. til order recd."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would! ! ! !  This McDonald's  has the worst food ever...\n\nI have went on 2 different  occasions & both times the food was disgusting, fries under cooked & burger was rubbery. When I called to complain the manager basically called me a liar. The food didn't even taste like regular mcdonalds  food . I won't go to that location ever again."}
{"text":"$12.99 family bundle is amazing ! Feeds my family with left overs. All you need is to purchase drinks additionally and your set."}
{"text":"The lobby is kind of dirty and frequently you will see line workers out back smoking with gloves on. My concern is excatly what are the odds they change those gloves between the dumpster and where the big Mac is made? Hmm. Well my ice coffee came out with the correct flavor and my food was hot and served in a some what timely mannor. The cashier was polite and didn't need me to repeat the order back to him 5xs so I count that as a win as well. Not a bad choice if yah Wana get a mucky Ds fix."}
{"text":"If I could post zero stars I would. Sat in the drive-thru for 10 minutes waiting for someone to take my order and acknowledge someone was waiting. I honked my horn only for the female walking by to ignore. Finally the gentleman from the cash register came over to the window and asked what's wrong...I explained no one was taking orders at the previous two windows and I watched the young girl walk past the window at least 4 times. His reply was \"she saw you but she said she's not working the window today!\" Are you serious? It's called customer service and team work! Evidently no one was working the window. They had a line of 3 cars behind me waiting at the previous window. I didn't even want to eat there after this episode so I politely called McDonald's hotline and drove to Carl's Jr! The worse service I've ever experienced at a McDonald's. Probably a sign that I need to stop eating there!"}
{"text":"It was the longest wait on drive through...  It was more than 20 min..  I don't know what was happened, but they could find some kind of solution, we just got to stuck..."}
{"text":"No toys with the kids meal and I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich and it looked like they let the chicken sit all day before serving it. Customer service was horrible no apology or anything. Not recommended"}
{"text":"Really wish no stars were a option, seeing as the snarky, rude, and sarcastic customer service sold me on the fact, that even as a McDonald's fast food worker, they obviously don't care about their crappy jobs. Nor do I except them to give two flying sh!ts about their reviews, because their lives are probably just as miserable as their burger flipping salary.  \n\nI've come here twice and both times my order was messed up, getting a hold of a manager was like five nights at Freddy's , and finally after contacting the dimwits I got a refunded order. After being treated like I was an inconvenience, I finally got to the window to order ( because their shitty microphones don't work) and decided to add a coca-cola, and a burger ( seeing as I just got off work and was hungrier then a hippo). The broad at the window acted as if her life was in shambles over the request, so I just smiled and continued on my way to the next window, where I was greeted by a nice young man who has worked a 12 hour shift, from what I was told and was scheduled to work even longer because the dipshit (my words not his) managers obviously can't make a schedule. Not only did the dumb broad from the first window start  squawking from the back but she was so annoying the poor man needed a break. I eventually got my food, and checked to make sure the food was there. Thankfully it was, and I didn't need to give the girl a experience she was not prepared for, but I asked for her name. SURPRISINGLY  HER NAME WAS MICKY. WHO WORKS AT MICKY DS.  amused with her life, I thanked her and drove away. \n\nBasically I'm sure she didn't graduate middle school, and I feel terrible for co-worker, who as I type this is probably hoping she trips and falls.  \n\nI literally made this account just to post this."}
{"text":"Sigh...I don't know why I even bothered to give this particular location another go after my last visit (see previous review). Everything went well until the one woman dropped off my food near the curb and I'm not asking you to do a tapdance for me as you drop my food off to me, but a simple smile or acknowledgement would be nice after I politely said \"Thank you! Have a nice day.\" Maybe she was having a bad day. NBD. Checked my food...no syrup or butter. ..a little annoyed, but not a huge deal. Park car. Get out in my wildly inappropriate leopard print pajama shorts to retrieve condiments. \n\nWait. Wait. Wait patiently for someone to acknowledge me or state \"can I help you?\"\n\nGirl eventually turns around after smacking a bag angerly out of her way and gives me a look with no words that clearly states, \"WHAT?\". Reaches over for condiments after I politely asked like I just asked her to pump maple syrup out of a tree for me. Hands them to me without a simple sorry, eye contact, nothing. \n\nI don't expect someone to bend over backwards to me, nor am I that critical of service...but body language and attitude are hard to pass up. \n\nMy next visit to McDonalds was at another location. Avoid this one at all costs."}
{"text":"The worst Mcdonalds I've been in.  Make sure and check your order before you leave. Chances are its missing something."}
{"text":"This place is horrible the bigger girl with the red hair is so rude. I waited an hour in the drive thru. This place should be shut down the way they run things. Never will I ever go back again the food was terrible cold and old"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. It's a prime example of why McDonalds is on the decline.\n\nI wait 15mins for an iced coffee, she brings it out without a straw.\n\n\"Well I thought someone else gave you one.\"  And then she just leaves, no attempt to correct the situation. Worst drive through service ever."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst McDonalds on the planet. The drive thru has got to be the slowest drive thru in the world. I have never had an order there where I didn't have to pull forward and wait. And the number of times I've driven all the way home only to find out they put the wrong order in the bag this has been going on for years."}
{"text":"Its 630am and im waiting in line for what seems like an eternity for two breakfast sandwiches what's wrong with this place they just can't get it right"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  They never have ice cream so take it off he menu and system is always down.  Now they don't have frappes.  Someone needs to come fix up this location.  Go to the one on Ridge road in the plaza they r awesome"}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would. Not only was the service horrible but our orders were also 100% incorrect. Egg mcmuffin with no egg?? What?"}
{"text":"I definitely agree with the previous reviews. If I could had saved my life before going to this location by just seeing the reviews I would've been done myself a favor! This place is ridiculous. I have literally been to this location like at least 5 times and I have seriously gotten the wrong order those five times!!! No kidding! I literally have to drive all the way back to get my order right. One of those five times my order was completely incorrect. I was able to catch a few mistakes before leaving the drive thru. When I got home, the forgot to give me my drinks & the other half of my order. I spoke to a manager and took \"responsibility\" about it but it happened again this last time. I'm never going again. I wasn't even able to get peanuts for my chocolate fudge sundae which I paid for. I believe if I'm paying for something I should be able to receive what I'm paying for. Regardless if it's just $1 or $2, I'm paying for it. I could've also been informed about it too. Never ever going back to this place. I'd rather drive 15 minutes more to a different McDonalds than to go to this one!!!!!!!!! If I could rate it a zero I would!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Mcdonalds ive ever visited. The tables were very dirty, the floor very sticky. The girl taking orders doesnt listen had to repeat my order 4 times. Id rather go eat at 632 n estrella pkway location down the road where they actually give a damn about the customer."}
{"text":"If this is the location inside the Wal-Mart, I would rather crawl across broken glass and then dive into a pool of rubbing alcohol, than eat at this location again. The managers are terrible on a good day. The employees couldn't care less about their job. The fries taste like they've been fried, frozen and then re-fried. They are horrible. EVERY TIME I GO THERE. Last time I went (my husband actually went...I was just standing there in silent protest), the manager and employees were taking pictures of each other with their cell phones. My husband stood there at the register for quite a bit while they finished screwing around, then the cashier (whose name I don't know because none of them wear name tags) reluctantly came over to help. I got the feeling he was annoyed that we interrupted him and his buddies... The husband got his food and before we made it out of the parking lot (thankfully), we realized the order was wrong and the fries were stale. Again. I so hate this location. Now I insist we go across the parking lot to the stand-alone one."}
{"text":"This address is for the one next to Panda Express, not the one in Walmart.\n\nThis place sucks and it doesnt even come close to any other McDonalds. How in the world can you have so many employees working and have a line of people waiting for their food? It's like there is retarded people working there and they all have special needs. This one guys was just waiting for a happy meal and had been waiting for 10 minutes before I even got there. It them about 15 minutes for them to give me my food. One mexican kid that was working was to busy flirting with this girl in front of everyone, while her father was asking why the food was taking so long to make. \n\nThe dining area was dirty after I got my food and sat down. They should fire the manager and everyone that works there. They take no pride in working there and its sad to see this. It shouldnt matter what they are being paid to be there, its still a job and they ARE being paid to be there. \n\nI will NOT be returning to this place......."}
{"text":"About 6 months ago, I left a comment on the McDonalds Corporate website describing that there store at this location had a dirty dining area.  Soon after that, a manager called me apologizing.\nWell, a few days ago we stopped here, order some food, and went into the dining area.  The internal disposal areas were over flowing with trays and food wrapping.  I watched as patrons wondered where they should put their trays and left overs.  Also, one area was inaccessible because there was standing water in the dining area floor.  Yet, there must of of been 10 employees behind the counter taking orders. I would guess the speed in which they process orders is paramount - cleanness in the dinning area is not.  Never again.  (These comments refer to the McDonalds on Estrella Parkway - not the McDonalds inside Wal-Mart.)"}
{"text":"I have tried this McD's a few times and always leave disappointed.  I am done with them now.  Every time I go I leave with a total disappointing mtg.  Either the service is terrible, the food is incomplete and cold and wrong and the restaurant is always unkempt.  I have mentioned it to the manager on duty each time and get an apology but nothing ever changes.  I also find it interesting that none of the comments hear are answered by the restaurant owner or McDonald's.  I guess the corporate office doesn't care either.  This one can go away forever."}
{"text":"This place is BAD! Horrible customer service and the lines are extremely long... Most of the time I have to repeat my order 3 to 4 times. I have even found plastic in my food. I don't think I will ever go here again..."}
{"text":"They have pumpkin spiced Lattes!  Today's service at 8:53am was not friendly.  No smiles or have a good day comments like usual."}
{"text":"They charge for a drink with meal packages, and then tell you there is nothing they can do to credit you.  Definitely communications problems, even with management. \n\nHave to ask for even salt, nothing is left out for customers, all is behind counter.\n\nI avoid this location- if I really need McDonalds, I drive 5 miles, not worth the effort to go here."}
{"text":"Two key points:\n\n1) It's new, so, it's still mostly clean and the grease traps haven't reached critical mass yet.\n\n2) If you're headed toward Tucson on I-10 east, this is really the last convenient place to get off before you get to Casa Grande exit 195 which is like a billion miles away. So if you're hungry GET OFF NOW.\n\nThat is all."}
{"text":"It's Mc Donald's. Was just plain ol Mc Donald's. Nothing special. Not great, not bad. Staff was friendly. Food was Mc Donald's."}
{"text":"This McDonald's can kiss it. And there servers. I only been here 3 times since its right around the corner form my work. I'd rather drive 10 miles to a good service and better food place then this. The service always sucks. The Piss inside lack communication and brains. As well as emotions. I think a robot could do better. And the food is always stale. Like its been under a heat lamp all day. Nasty fools."}
{"text":"How difficult is it to just get the order correct? Food was good, but did not put the requested and confirmed sauce in the bag for my nuggets. The nuggets are not good without sauce. It's like having a hamburger with no condiments or cheese. Can't wait till the minimum wage goes to $12 an hour so we can pay $10 for the same quality of food and dissatisfying service. Still hungry...."}
{"text":"Run of the mill McDonald's which is one convenient exit & about two blocks off the freeway.  Appears to be a newer building with two ordering lanes.  There's a HUGE cactus for you to stare at while waiting for your order to come up."}
{"text":"I passed by this McDonald's on my way out of the state and decided to check it out. I only got a large fry and a medium Sprite but it was still of high quality. The fries were extremely fresh and salted perfectly; they were the perfect batch of fries. The employees I interacted with were very kind as well."}
{"text":"Looks like most people are unhappy with this location.\n\nIt's right off I 10 but bushes and trees actually hide it.\n\nThere's just enough parking.\n\nIt's clean but the lady who wipes the tables and cleans the floors seems mentally unstable.\n\nNo kids area.\n\nThe service is really the reason I'm giving 4 stars.\n\nThere's multiple electrical outlets but only the ones in the wall work, the ones in the dividers do not.\n\nThe Wifi signal doesn't drop too often"}
{"text":"I come here occasionally as it is close to work and cheap eats.  I can't say I've really had some of the issues others have.  Food's been generally fine and seemed fresh within reason for fast food, the staff usually is cool and the wait time varies from eh to good.\n\nThe only thing that bugs me is you have to remember to ask for ketchup because they rarely if ever ask and I've yet to have them just give it to me.  I *LIKE* ketchup with my fries, dang it!"}
{"text":"Not only are they inattentive and rude, but they cannot seem to get a $10 order correct. How hard is it to assemble three breakfast sandwiches in the 21st Century? Maybe this McD's ran out of eggs & cheese and the cashier was too pusillanimous to notify customers. I suppose they might not have been properly trained to put a slice of cheese of a piece of meat. Perhaps there is some quota of fouled-up orders these kids have to fulfill. Nope, it appears they are just incompetent adults who cannot accomplish the simple task of placing pre-formed ingredients together as described in the operations manual. What you should do is deduct an allotment of money for every order your employees mess up. After all, when I get a refund for my order, the franchise owner eats the cost of the order, not the garbage employee who, somehow, does not have the ability to combine egg, cheese, and sausage onto two small pancakes. There's no incentive to complete the order properly. This is why Arby's at Love's is becoming more preferred. And with more fast-food options coming to the East side of Interstate 10, you cannot afford to retain worthless employees."}
{"text":"I had no choice, but to choose a star. Over the years this Mc Donalds continues to disappoint.  I truly believe this franchise owner really does not care. This morning will be last time I go there. The people at my job have had similar dissapointing experiences with the same place. It is close and convenient for us. But they would rather go to another location nearby or somewhere close to their home, when commuting to work. This morning I ordered strawberry cream pie and was told again that they had none and asked if can be I would like apple pies instead. About fifteen minutes later at work. The apple pie was hard as a rock. More like a apple biscuit. This is the final straw. This place is horrible. The list of things that I have ordered over time is too long to list. Mc Donald Corp should pull their licensing away from owner. I have took time from my day to write this, rather than spending it on something else more productive."}
{"text":"horrible old buns,.food cold first.mcdonalds that really messed up a simple burger###yeah fellow yelpers stay away from this one!"}
{"text":"I've worked next to this McDonald's since it opened so I've grabbed many a meal there. Rarely disappoints. The staff is very friendly and courteous. So much so that last night when I had a HORRIBLE day and left work hangry and shaking I ordered and paid with a $50 bill.....and forgot my change. I got home and realized what I had done (I live 20 miles away) so I stopped back in the next day figuring I would be out my change. Luckily the wonderful woman who helped me had caught the error and put my change away in the safe for me in case I returned. He dayshift manager helped me and he was awesome and friendly as well. I'm so grateful for the friendly and honest workers at this McDonald's. Thank you!"}

{"text":"Looks like most people are unhappy with this location.\n\nIt's right off I 10 but bushes and trees actually hide it.\n\nThere's just enough parking.\n\nIt's clean but the lady who wipes the tables and cleans the floors seems mentally unstable.\n\nNo kids area.\n\nThe service is really the reason I'm giving 4 stars.\n\nThere's multiple electrical outlets but only the ones in the wall work, the ones in the dividers do not.\n\nThe Wifi signal doesn't drop too often"}
{"text":"I come here occasionally as it is close to work and cheap eats.  I can't say I've really had some of the issues others have.  Food's been generally fine and seemed fresh within reason for fast food, the staff usually is cool and the wait time varies from eh to good.\n\nThe only thing that bugs me is you have to remember to ask for ketchup because they rarely if ever ask and I've yet to have them just give it to me.  I *LIKE* ketchup with my fries, dang it!"}
{"text":"Not only are they inattentive and rude, but they cannot seem to get a $10 order correct. How hard is it to assemble three breakfast sandwiches in the 21st Century? Maybe this McD's ran out of eggs & cheese and the cashier was too pusillanimous to notify customers. I suppose they might not have been properly trained to put a slice of cheese of a piece of meat. Perhaps there is some quota of fouled-up orders these kids have to fulfill. Nope, it appears they are just incompetent adults who cannot accomplish the simple task of placing pre-formed ingredients together as described in the operations manual. What you should do is deduct an allotment of money for every order your employees mess up. After all, when I get a refund for my order, the franchise owner eats the cost of the order, not the garbage employee who, somehow, does not have the ability to combine egg, cheese, and sausage onto two small pancakes. There's no incentive to complete the order properly. This is why Arby's at Love's is becoming more preferred. And with more fast-food options coming to the East side of Interstate 10, you cannot afford to retain worthless employees."}
{"text":"I had no choice, but to choose a star. Over the years this Mc Donalds continues to disappoint.  I truly believe this franchise owner really does not care. This morning will be last time I go there. The people at my job have had similar dissapointing experiences with the same place. It is close and convenient for us. But they would rather go to another location nearby or somewhere close to their home, when commuting to work. This morning I ordered strawberry cream pie and was told again that they had none and asked if can be I would like apple pies instead. About fifteen minutes later at work. The apple pie was hard as a rock. More like a apple biscuit. This is the final straw. This place is horrible. The list of things that I have ordered over time is too long to list. Mc Donald Corp should pull their licensing away from owner. I have took time from my day to write this, rather than spending it on something else more productive."}

{"text":"I've worked next to this McDonald's since it opened so I've grabbed many a meal there. Rarely disappoints. The staff is very friendly and courteous. So much so that last night when I had a HORRIBLE day and left work hangry and shaking I ordered and paid with a $50 bill.....and forgot my change. I got home and realized what I had done (I live 20 miles away) so I stopped back in the next day figuring I would be out my change. Luckily the wonderful woman who helped me had caught the error and put my change away in the safe for me in case I returned. He dayshift manager helped me and he was awesome and friendly as well. I'm so grateful for the friendly and honest workers at this McDonald's. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is the poorest excuse of a McDonalds. Never get the orders right and half the time food is cold."}
{"text":"Declining service at this location...  We only use McDonald's drive thru and in the past 5 visits they have screwed up our order every time.  We now have to check out the order before we drive away.  Too much of an effort for junk food.  We'll go to Burger King instead."}
{"text":"Worst mcdonalds i have ever been to.\nOf the 6 customers in fro t of me they messed up 5 orders."}
{"text":"I come to this McDonald's location now and then because it is close to where I work.  I usually just get coffee.  One time I decided to use the washroom.  Wow talk about dirty!  Perhaps it's because it's a pretty solidly busy location but there was strange pee on the toilet seat.  ugh."}
{"text":"I should write an update seeing I was contacted to resolve my issues. To resolve my issues first, I did go out of my way to contact the general manager to let him know what had happened and he seemed to not know there was an issue but did offer to comp my meal next time i visited. I thought this was the end of it so I left it alone. Then I believe a new GM has taken over named Nikki who went out of her way to still contact me since nobody had updated their log in response to my complaint since September. She was very friendly and apologetic about my experience and did offer to resolve it even further so I would actually leave happy. This action out of good faith alone is the only reason I came back to update my review as I think this deserves credit. I would give Nikki 5 stars if I could but I'll settle with 4 considering this really shouldn't have taken 3 months and a change of management to fix when headquarters knew about this."}
{"text":"The customer service here was terrible. I rolled up to the drive-thru and waited, about 2 minutes later, a woman finally says can I help you? LOL what about welcome to McDonalds! Would you like to try our new salads? \n\n\n\nGo to another location"}
{"text":"My friend decided to treat me to McDonald's on Sunday April 14 @ 2AM. Things went downhill the moment we went in. First, the cashier punched in the wrong order; Second, the meals were served cold; Third, we were charged incorrectly; and Forth, the food made me sick. I can say this: I am never going back, my worst experience at McDonald's, ever!"}
{"text":"The worst McDonald's I've ever been to. I went inside to order 3 Drinks and a small fry. I waited 15 minutes, during this I went to the bathroom and there was a huge cockroach on the floor. Then walked back up to the counter to ask for my order, and they made me reorder. it took me another 10 minutes to get my order and they didn't even put ice in my drinks. the girl at the counter didn't even speak English, which would be fine if she wasn't the one who was taking orders. It took me 25 minutes to get 3 drinks and a small fry."}
{"text":"If you want to go to a fast food restaurant to be ignored, then this is the place.  The employees go out of there way to ignore anyone who might be in line.  Only when there is a line of 5 people do they slither to the counter.  Horrible business."}
{"text":"Typical McDonald's.  They open whenever they want, serve food that's hours old, and pretend the can't hear you through the drive thru mic."}
{"text":"We love this McDonald's--always fast and accurate. We occasionally take our kids here and the play area is super clean. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This is the Wal-ly World of fast food places. Everything processed and genetically engineered. There is a reason it tastes exactly the same no matter which one you go to. Scary.\nI have to give them an extra star, per my own rule, because they do serve Coke Zero. The only reason I was even here was they had free food but even for free the price is too high. I am one who doesn't turn down free food but from Micky Ds I just might.\nThe restaurant, for lack of a better term, itself is nice. Clean and efficient. Nice staff. But overall it is still a McDonald's. Satan won't even eat here. Nor are there any McDonald's in hell because the Devil thinks it is cruel and unusual punishment.\nOn the plus side there are Unicorns in the ball pit and they serve alcohol upstairs but you have to ask nice and know the secret password.\nI will try my best to never go to a McDonald's again but once in a while they have cheap or free Big Macs which might lure me back for a second or two. It is sad that at the mire mention of the word Big Mac I can almost taste one. Ugh.\nI am sure some people like McDonald's and think it is a good value with fast and friendly service. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. In my opinion though with so many other great choices, some a thousand times better, why still go here. Oh well. Evil exists so we know what good is."}
{"text":"If you like Mc Donald's food, then this is a very good location. The location is very convenient and has entrances from 2 streets. The parking lot is kind of a pain to navigate but the lot is very clean. The employees at this location are very courteous and seem to be in a better mood than in most Mc Donald's locations. The drive thru here is extremely fast, even though it only has 1 lane going in. Overall, I definitely recommend this location over any of the others in the area.\n\nStill McDonald's food, though..."}
{"text":"Well there's a reason McDonald's has the bad reputation it does. Moments like this reiterate the truth in my mind that any money spent at McDonald's, no matter how cheap, is a complete waste. $2.16 for two large sweet teas turned into $2.16 for two large sewer waters. I'm utterly disappointed again that a McDonald's worker doesn't even seem to have the simple capability of pushing the sweet tea button instead of the regular tea button and even then, brew a regular tea correctly (I believe they switched the sweet tea and regular tea around but even then, the tea was gross). Going home now to spend at least $2.16 in sugar packets to sweeten this baby up, then cry."}
{"text":"The people are so nice here. I come here after I take my son to school for a few minutes of me time to eat breakfast on my days off. The the Lobby is clean. There are frequent daily visitors that I see regularly reading the newspaper or checking their wifi."}
{"text":"The food is, well, standard McDonald's fare. The service at this place was slow, unusual since not many customers were in evidence. The young kid who took my order was distracted by something shiny, and it took him a while to notice I was standing directly in front of him waiting to place my order. Still, one extra star since they take Apple Pay."}
{"text":"Morning manager is always rude over the drive through intercom, once I pull up to the window he is still rude but does ease up a bit (guess he doesn't want to piss anyone off to their face). Never had a problem with their food, only the morning crews shitty attitudes."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying I rarely eat fast food let alone Mcdonald's but I've stopped at this one 3 times in the last 6 months because of it's close proximity to my work. The first time two times i got what you'd expect from a mcdonald's.  Shitty service from bratty people and a mediocre meal. Ok whatever it's not like I'm at a fine dining establishment. But this last time was enough to make Jesus want to flip tables again. If i wanted stone cold food and half a fry box served on the side with a shitty attitude I'd eat my roommates home \"cooked\" meals. The most upsetting part was the complete rudeness of your shift manager. Not only did he try to convince me I was crazy for being put off by the horribly under cooked food he acted like he was doing me a favor by giving me my money back. There's a reason why McDonald's has a shrinking profit margarin every quarter (*hint* it's your self entitled \"i deserve $15/hr but can't cook a chicken to proper temp\" employees)."}
{"text":"My first time here and for some odd reason my sausage muffin sandwich had a foul smell to it and the muffin taste like 3 days old. The bathroom smells so bad too.. never again."}
{"text":"I like how this McDonald's is within the TTC fare paid area - I think it's the only one in the whole TTC subway system. This lets me grab food and drink on my commute, and saves me from paying an extra token to get out of the station.\n\nAs far as service goes, the service counter within the station is rather narrow, but hey it works. The staff and food quality are on par with other McDonald's locations; nothing especially bad or good."}
{"text":"Fine for a quick coffee or a Jr chicken/ snack wrap. I've never ordered anything fancy from this Macs but other yelpers seem to think on the slow side.  Connected to st clair station its handy if you are waiting for a streetcar and suddenly get an itch for something cheap and greasy."}
{"text":"It's a McDonalds. There's nothing you can say about the food that people don't already know and either love or hate (but still probably secretly crave that guilty pleasure of some nuggets and fries from time-to-time). \n\nWhat is notable about this location is that A - it's connected to the St. Clair subway station and B - it's 24 hours. \n\nThis tiny little location is nothing special. It's very plain; you might mistakenly walk in here when heading to subway station if you weren't paying attention. There is no seating (although there is a bar-height window ledge if you want to stand around the front). \n\nIt's quite clean for your typical fast food joint (even a peak behind the counter into the kitchen showed shiny stainless steal and bright white walls) and despite only a couple of people working the graveyard shift my order was delivered very quickly, hot, fresh, and neatly prepared even during a bit of a post-bar-night rush.  \n\nMost conveniently and what makes this stand out from your average Mickey D's is the take-out style counter in the streetcar bay, where you can pause in-transit to fuel up."}
{"text":"Here's an oddity: a hole-in-the-wall McDonald's. Stuck right off the side of St. Clair Subway Station, this Mickey D's is small enough without having some walls boarded up for renovation. If you're looking for a sit-down dining experience, you won't get it here--it's take-out only at this point.\n\nWhen I was here with some hungry friends the other night, we inundated them with coupons for two-for-one Big Macs. They accommodated us pretty well, but they did forget to give me ketchup for my fries. To be fair, it was the sixth order of fries from our group, so I don't grudge them for forgetting."}
{"text":"A little McDonald's kiosk beside the subway station. Every so often I have to go to the residential tenancy board near this location,  and this is my source for $1 ice coffees and cookies!  They also have a McDonald's full menu,  but I try to avoid their other food like products subsequent to watching the \"supersize me\" documentary some years ago. They have no tables at this location,  it's strictly a takeout location."}
{"text":"E"}
{"text":"I got a ranch chicken snack wrap here the other day.  The girl asked for my name to write on my bill even though I was the only customer there. I reluctantly complied. The wrap was good. The chicken portion was a shade small."}
{"text":"Go here for take out only and do expect a bit of a wait.\n\nI would say this is more of a take out counter than an actual restaurant.  I'd compare it to the Union Station location but on a smaller scale... but at least when you line up, it's indoors.\n\nThe narrow layout lends itself to only 2 cash registers being open if you access from St. Clair. If you don't want to leave the TTC system and save on excess fare, there is a separate order counter there but there is only 1 cash register.\n\nThe narrow layout doesn't help the cashiers as from there perspective, it can always seem busy even if the lineup is only about 4 or 5 deep. This leads to them seeming stressed out and not always giving you the service you might expect... or a \"free smile\".\n\nThe low ranking lends to the layout, atmosphere, wait times, and friendliness of the staff.\n\nThe one thing that McDonald's is known for is providing a consistent food product and thankfully, if you need to come here, you'll get what you expect. If you're in the neighbourhood and you're hungry for McDonald's, this place isn't bad but there is a better location just a bit north at Yonge & Eglinton."}
{"text":"The shittiest McDonalds in the city.\n\nThe people who run this obviously don't care. Why not? There's plans to knock down the plaza and build condos.\n\nThe service here is reprehensible. They rarely get the order right. Its damn near impossibe for these people to even get COFFEE right.\n\nThere are countless homeless people who come in to bother customers, and they do nothing about it. There are vagrants who hang around the front of the restaurant, begging for change, coffee stickers, etc...and some will even go into the garbage to fish out a cup, or leftover fries.\n\nVery often, during the night, the restaurant will look like a garbage compactor threw up. The staff have absolutely no pride in their work, as it shows with the condition of the restaurant. \n\nMcDonalds is supposed to be a family restaurant, but the music they have on in the background is hardly family friendly. I would never let kids listen to top 40 music, especially with the uncensored nature of the lyrics.\n\nIf they're short staffed, they need to hire people. There's no excuse for this location whatsoever."}
{"text":"Thank God I don't eat McDonald's food but I truly love their coffee so when I'm working in the area this is the McDonald's where I have to get my coffee fix- so three times a week at 1:30 PM I walk in and there's two cashiers working and a lineup of people a mile long waiting to be served- isn't 1:30pm still considered lunchtime ??? it just boggles my mind and it's so frustrating waiting for large coffee to go  to be made by six people behind the counter chatting laughing giggling and not doing much of anything. But I need my coffee fix I have no other choice so I will stand their roll my eyes secretly and wait for my $2.00 coffee."}
{"text":"This McDonald's once denied me breakfast at 10:29am, but the person right before me ordered the full sausage shabang sans problem. I was eight months pregnant. Think about this. The fucking nerve. \n\nAlas, I've willingly returned a couple of times like a dirty bee, so I can't give them only one star. However, I will go on record saying this is my least favourite McDonald's ever, and I am (sadly) an expert."}
{"text":"I like the idea of their summer promo.  $1 for any sized pop or iced coffee.  Cool!  I love a good deal!  Plus, their vanilla iced latte is a high calorie (so bad...so good) yummy beverage.  Or so I thought so. \n\nI was at work and just finished drinking the iced coffee I got from this McD's drive thru.  I had literally just thrown the empty cup in the garbage.  My coworker comes in and says that she just got an iced coffee from this spot (from their drive thru too) and it had a cockroach in it.\n\nMmmm....iced coffee, now served with cockroaches!  Is that's why it is so cheap for the summer?!"}
{"text":"The local Mickey D's. The one everyone in the hood knows and goes to. \n\nIf you were a kid growing up in Parkdale you have at least one story about this place. You probably came here for some kid's birthday party when they offered those here. The old ball pit was probably where you caught your first contagious childhood virus (Probably why it's not there anymore). A nerd growing up? You probably got your lunch stolen here once. \n\nThis Mcdonalds is in the lower spectrum of Mcdonalds the world has to offer. The place is dirty and smells of pee. All day, everyday, the tables are sticky or just plain messy. The service is pretty bad since you'll probably be served by a bunch of teens who probably forgot about the \"fast\" in fast food. The food? Well you should know what to expect. It's not like this place does things different when it comes to the Big Mac. \n\nYep, there isn't much to say about my local Mcdonalds. It is of course, just a Mcdonalds."}
{"text":"For some reason, I end up here after drinking nights. I don't know this area of town at all but found myself here on 4 different occasions. Two times after  Concerts at the Molson Amphitheatre and the other times after drinking on King / Queen west. The restaurant tends to be messy but could be because it tends to be filled with drunk people at that time. Great people watching though - You see some \"interesting\" people. After my McChicken combo and hamburger on the side, I grab a cab outside and head back to Markham in the wee hours of the morning. \n\nBK"}
{"text":"This place is not great, it's familiar.  It's the local Mc Choke n' Pukes in Parkdale and therefore the local gathering spot for every business person, working poor and general miscreant in the neighbourhood.  It's often riddled with sketchy people at all hours of day and night, so the clubbers will see the down and out drugged out or passed out from drink/meds and just trying to sleep out of the cold in various corners.  The tables are dirty and covered with far too many napkins used and not used, the garbage is overflowing, the drink lids are sticky, and the service is hit and miss.  Sometimes the cashiers are rude, sometimes not as rude.  The food has never upset my stomach which for me is the main selling point. Most people don't go to Mickie d's for the ambiance, so take it with a grain of salt.  It's by far not the cleanest place, but it's not the worst either.  For the locals i think it suits us fine.  If you want clean and to spend more money, check out liberty village down the road."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of the golden arches but I can't really complain about their breakfast... It's cheap, quick, tasty and soaks up alcohol like a charm!\n\nMove over people of Walmart because the patrons at this McDonalds are some of the sketchiest people I have ever seen! Despite this the staff is nice, quick and generally competent. These three things are key and given how much bullshit they endure (man smelling of urine dumps $10 is pennies on their counter and proceeds to count them out loud!), I am surprised I still get served with a smile.\n\nThis location has also recently gone under renovation and it looks like they will be the test location for the new McDonalds cafe. Since there are no coffee joints in this immediate area, I am sad to say that this news made me very happy :-)"}
{"text":"I would give no stars if i could... they're supposedly open for \"24\" hours but they CLOSE at 3am to get ready for breakfast which starts at 6am? I don't see why they need to close the restaurant for 3 hours to cook eggs and sausages when they're supposed to be open 24 hours and if they do close for 3 hours prior to the actual breakfast start time they should have unlimited supply for breakfast and yet people have to wait for them to make our food cause they have to cook more... false advertisement? I mean they do have a huge 24 hour sign there for a reason..."}
{"text":"People who have lived around a McDonald's will know they all have kind of a personality with their clientele. This McD's is no exception. This locale's specialty is daily get-togethers of the local... older, \"special\" people. You know the ones, they get their McCafe, go to the toilets, and you seem them on your way outside the McD's sitting on the floor against a building wall, with the McCafe cup presented for generous income. They'll sit together, and as soon as one of their crew walks in they could yell out his name, happy to be together in a McD's.\nThat's this McD's personality. You usually see the same crowd of people there, the local kids out of school, Filipino adults out of work, and many old white people with a spiritual wolf of the woods t shirt. But it's all good. It's McDonald's, it's reliable, it's what you want, and it's open 24 hours for our greatest enjoyment.\nJust don't always use the toilet if you can avoid it. They're CLEAN, but you never know what that last shady guy you just saw leaving could have done there. Also they're too small for the crowd I find."}
{"text":"They will mess up your order and/or make you wait a long time to get it. Nothing wrong with the food itself, although had the most disgusting coffee of my life here, watery and gross, didn't taste like coffee at all. It's McDonald's, with a little less consistency at this location.\n\nThey deal with crazies from Parkdale all day long so it's kind of understandable, but between how much EVERYONE complains about their orders being messed up here, super long wait times, and them just straight up forgetting your order, it's kind of embarrassing."}
{"text":"I love McDonald's and this location is the worst I've ever been too (Canada or US).\n\nLast night I got in line in the drive-thru and tried to order a salad (No Salads- at all). Ok, I'll have a filet o' fish (No Filet o' Fishes), ok, well I'll have whatever you do have. When I got to the cash, I asked if perhaps I could get a coupon to make the next visit a little better since nothing I wanted on the menu was available. The cashier reluctantly said yes, left for a few minutes, then came back and said her manager said no. \n\nI got the food home in about 5 minutes and it was entirely inedible. \n\nI like McDonald's a lot, but in this case, Burger King across the street would have been a better bet (Burger King!!!). Insanity. Horrible."}
{"text":"A two-star average at this McDonald's as of this writing, so I gave it three, because I'm waiting in line for so long it gave me the time to write this review. \n\nToday, the drive through has a garbage can in the way - staff's way of letting customers know it's out of order - some customers manage to steer around the garbage can and sit in the drive thru to no avail; sadly humorous, in a way...\n\nPull up to the drive through window? Get ignored...\n\nGo inside and wait so long, you leave a Yelp review - only one register open, with an incompetent trainee who needs help for every transaction of numerous people ahead of me - the poor guy help the trainee is clearly bottling up frustration... \n\nYou know what? I'll give it two stars, and that's generous tonight. \n\nThis McDonalds is a decent experience about half the time - just enough to remind you to go elsewhere before too long - a good deterrent that will break your streak if you're hooked!"}
{"text":"This mcdonalds has been upgraded and looks great now. They have the interactive touch screens for self serve ordering and all kinds of nice upgraded additions. Feels more modern with today's technology. I love it :D"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely disgusting.\n\n I have never been so repulsed by a restaurant. When we walked in, the place was like a barn. There were used spoons, cups and cardboard containers near the drink fountain and ketchup dispenser. The garbage bins were overflowing and many tables were dirty. I know  should have complained. I also know that people are not going to stop going to this Mcdonalds but I certainly hope someone who has authority that works there is reading this. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Why 4 stars? It's McDonalds, that's why. Its consistent but not great. But we were all raised on this stuff so its hard to hate it. \n\nThis particular McDonalds is clean and remodeled. Service is on the slower side and one time they totally drove me crazy by not accepting a McDonalds coupon that I got in a Pats Run swag bag. \n\nI'm grateful to have it in the neighborhood."}

Now, I know you can't control what the people in front of you in the drive thru order, but, if their order is going to take awhile to fill, have them pull up and park.\n\nSo the drive-thru was S L O W. However, the Egg Nog shakes ($2.69) were really pretty good. They were mixed well which can be a problem. Check out the Shamrock Shake (K's second favorite) and sometimes it's basically like a white and green swirl.\n\nC got an Oreo McFlurry ($2.69). He could care less if it's mixed or not.

{"text":"this place is awesome the only bad thing about it is management. Which is a big deal! \n\nI complained to corporate today.\nFirst time I ever do this and I felt bad about it but I had to!!\nI waited in the parking lot for 10 min during lunch time after ordering through drive thru for some cheese sticks and a hot n spicy. I was gonna be late to work so I decided to go in to ask for my food. I am not the kind of person to complain so I wasn't going there with the intention of arguing just figure they forgot idk.. As I was walking in I ran into an employee who was bringing some food out and he asked me if I was waiting for fish. I told him no and explain what I was waiting for. I could see in his face he had given the wrong bag to someone else so I followed him to the register. Again I wasn't being rude. I know people make mistakes all the time and he probably just got confused because it was lunch time and it was busy. \nAs he explained to the manager what happened she started yelling at him! In from of everyone in front of other employees and customers that he had given the wrong food to someone else. She wouldn't stop yelling at him and repeated the same thing a few times. I could tell the poor boy was so embarrassed so I decided to step in and told the manager there was no need to yell at him that I could wait and that it was fine. She rolled her eyes with no apology and turned her back at me and I could tell that she got embarrassed and really pissed old because I did the same thing to her as she did to him. I am sorry but this is not the first time or the second that this manager has acted so rude towards me or other customers. So i got her name and called corporate office. This is no way to treat you coworkers. You are no better than him or any other person that works there. there has to be something done and I am gonna make sure something gets done. I am not sorry for this Angela (manager) you are a horrible person and I hope you learn your lesson. and you know this is not the first time that someone has complained about you."}
{"text":"I stopped on the way home tonight. It was dinner hour and pretty empty in the dining room. I think there were three customers in the dining area. There wasn't a line, but customers had to wait because the staff was more concerned about the schedule than the few customers that were waiting. We weren't even recognized as we stood waiting for service. Staff is loud, ever see \"king burger\" video? I think bon qui qui might work here. Inside is nicely decorated, but few totally sterile. You could probably just bring a hose in to clean it since there are few padded seats. I will choose a different one next time. McDonald's has changed so much over the years it's hard to recognized."}
{"text":"To say the employees here are rude would be putting it mildly. \n\nI come here frequently, not because it is the best McDonald's, but rather because it is the closest McDonald's. The food here is okay at best, for a McDonald's. It's certainly better than either location on Chandler Boulevard. However, my major complaint is that no matter what time of day I come or if I go drive through versus inside, not a single employee thanks me for my business. \n\nIt especially irks me because as someone who has worked customer service, I always make a point of thanking the people who are providing me the service. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the same courtesy from people where I choose to spend my money, thus providing them a job.\n\nApart from the blatantly rude service, this location seems to have a problem with employees never emptying trash cans. Especially at the drive through. I can't count how many times I've come, even in the morning, and that trashcan is overflowing. I'm not sure if it's a problem for the health department or not, but I can tell you that it's really disgusting to see birds and flies hang around the trashcan right in front of where I'm picking up my food. Food and trash literally overflow. It's a similar case inside the restaurant, especially at the cans near the bathroom.\n\nOverall this is an okay McDonald's if you just need one that's close by, but don't expect it to be a great McDonald's."}
{"text":"I just went in to use the restroom and get a large drink. The rest room was spotless I was so surprised and happy at how clean it was. My drink came to a dollar 9 I had $1 cash with me and the gentleman at the counter who was helping me reached in his pocket and pulled out the rest of the money to help me pay for it. I thought that was the kindest gesture ever. Not only that he was very very polite. Everybody behind the counter greeted me I will definitely be coming back to this place"}
{"text":"I ordered large fries and they didn't fill them up to the top I feel like I paid for large but got small fries"}
{"text":"This place was fancy. Decorated nicely, even filled with video games to keep those screaming kids quiet.\n\nFood was super fresh. They perfected my double cheesy burger, tons of seasoning and diced onions. My only complaint is that they put both slices of cheese in between the meat patties instead of the cheese, meat, cheese, meat setup that every other Mc Donalds does.\n\nClean bathrooms, friendly service...perfect rest stop."}
{"text":"Probably the nicest McDonalds I've been in in a while. Staff is friendly, place is spotless, and on table has video games built into the counter for the kids. Pretty cool."}
{"text":"This evening, being 10/07/2016, between 6:15-6:30pm, my husband made a special trip for me to this McDonald's on Warner Road in Ahwatukee to get me a Filet-O-Fish sandwich and a small French fry order.  He first went to a Greek restaurant to get what he wanted before getting my order and was treated kindly, as usual!  When he went into to make my order at McDonald's the woman working up front was rude from beginning to end.  By the time my husband got home, he was so upset as how he was treated at McDonald's.  He was so upset, he forgot to get his receipt, but I'm going to turn this complaint into the McDonald's company tonight.  There is no reason to be rude to your customers, I don't care where you work.  I told my husband that we are going to start going to Burger King across the street from now on out!  McDonald's has lost our business!!!!!!"}
{"text":"As a guy with kids I've been a frequent visitor to McDonald's all around this great country. I've kept a mental list of the best and worst McDonald's we've visited. Congratulations are in order to this location for finally officially taking top spot from the Maricopa location on John Wayne Pkwy as the WORST McDonald's in existence. How fortunate am I to have a beautiful house in Ahwatukee next to this pathetic and disgusting excuse for a fast food joint. I have waited a year to give them an opportunity to improve or change managers but whatever is wrong here runs deep. It is almost miraculous how standard McDonald's fare can be prepared to taste this bad and be this unappealing despite the obvious attempts to provide equipment and product that makes it foolproof and consistent. In order to keep my faith in humanity I must assume the staff is intentionally trying to undermine and destroy McDonald's reputation. Normal human beings are likely incapable of this level of pure incompetence. The lobby is layered in old food and filth, the employees are angry and rude, the orders are incomplete or wrong, and everything takes for-ev-er. While I sit here I hear two more people ask to speak to the manager (don't bother we've done that too over the past year-nothing will change) and I hear employees arguing with each other and using foul language. NONE OF THIS IS UNIQUE TO THIS VISIT. We are done with this location permanently and will take extra time and gas to cross I-10 to a better location.  Please do yourself a favor and do the same."}
{"text":"Absolutely the slowest McDonald's in town. All four times this month I have had to wait 20 minutes !!!! So much for fast food"}
{"text":"This is a nice, clean location, has dual drive thru lanes, and is insanely fast!! I am very impressed with how efficient they are."}
{"text":"Slow service with remodeled location.  Food was hot and all but the service was eh.  Don't think I'll stop by again."}
{"text":"One of the slowest places I've been to. Do they know it's supposed to be FAST FOOD!? They seem surprised when people show up to  eat at 11:30 for lunch.  They give you some lame excuse for your order taking so long such as \"waiting on fries\"  and then when you get them they're cold, or they mess up your order and you have to wait even longer while they fix it. \nMaybe under new management they might do better but I don't know. Maybe McDonald's has just given up."}
{"text":"This McDonalds is not too bad, sometimes it's hit & miss here. The experiences I've had with customer service was ok and a few times they've messed up on my order but was gladly able to fix the issues. The location of the drive thru is horrible, they could have designed it better with a crammed small parking lot it makes for an inconvenience wait while cars are trying to maneuver around you just to exit the parking lot."}
{"text":"shit !  It took 25 minutes to get my food at 12:30 in the afternoon on Friday the 11th. I'm not going back"}
{"text":"I've been to many Mcdonald around the valley and I always order the same thing. I like the large sugar-free vanilla ice coffee with 4 Splenda. Only this location is consistent and it alway taste good. I told that to the girl at the window and she said, we try! \nI guess that means the rest of them don't. \n\nGood job!"}
{"text":"The employee that works graveyard at this location was very rude and impatient. I didn't get his name but he was no help. We asked for the price again when we got to the window, he said \"i don't know\" and just stood there. If you can't handle your shift without a smile, then you need to go kid."}
{"text":"On two separate occasions my husband and I brought our kids here for some happy meals and play time and there was some kind of spit or snot in my drink the first time and some kind of spit or snot in two of my three kids drinks the second time.\n\nI ALWAYS look before any of us drink from any fast food and thank goodness I do!!\n\nI will never take my kids there again and I don't advise anyone go to that location.\n\nWe are sending a letter to corporate."}
{"text":"I used to live on this side of town and would come here once in awhile. Back then, the service was alright. I had to wait once in awhile at the front because the drive through was backed up. And they would get my order right. Today, when I stopped for a quick bite to eat before class, I went through the drive through and was surprised that the line wasn't too crazy. I ordered a McDouble, no pickles, medium french fries and a large sweet tea. Paid & got my food - awesome quickness. BUT when I got to school and started to eat - my cheese burger had pickles. Not only did it have pickles, it had the receipt that said \"(1) McDouble; NO pickles.\" And my sweet tea was watered down and not so sweet, more like bland. Also, my french fries was thrown in the bag & practically poured out of the little holder.\nReally McDonald's? We're going to lower our food services because we have an updated drive through terminal? Just because I go through drive through, does not mean you RUSH me through. I like my food to be made to order. Thanks."}
{"text":"I asked them NO meat on my breakfast brisket and it was repeted to the person makin it.and when I got it there was becon on it.. but eggs were good n fresh"}
{"text":"McDonalds is a McDonalds, they are pretty much the same. Except this one was a bit different. Looked nice inside, roomy and clean. Either a new building or they have remodeled it recently. No disgusting odors or greasy floors. The stuff is polite, the service is fast. I ordered a file fish sandwich, it was good. Nothing extraordinary, but not bad at all."}
{"text":"The credit card system is down  and they don't tell you until you get up to order. So than you are stuck in line to pull through."}
{"text":"I take my gfs son here pretty often but I Hate it due to the fact that the only people that actually work in this establishment are the elderly maintenance gentleman and one fairly old woman behind the counter.  I mean I get it right first job fast food handler and you don't get paid much. But come on how many times can you screw up a burger when they post on the board what should and should not be on it!  I want to cut them some slack but it is on every dang visit and that is just unacceptable. If they can't jack it seems them packing plenty of kids looking to work find some that will actually put some effort into something I think we all agree on can't really be that difficult.  Or just keep being terrible what do I know you are all over the planet after all."}
{"text":"Worse McDonald's ever. The employees are very rude and have nasty attitudes specially Gloria. I called in because they messed up my drive through order and right when I said that her tone change to a bitchy tone I also explain that they gave me expired milk that was for my son her reply to that was... so what ?..do you wanna come and get it?!..she never once apologized about it. Then I told her unfortunately I don't live near by so I  can can't go pick it up she then replies her exact words so what do you want then.? Super rude so then she hang up the phone before I could even reply. I've never left a review but this to me was extremely annoying and rude I had to make a complaint about it. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"A little disappointed that this large franchise does not support military by offering a discount but what do you expect...its McDonalds! I bought my son a happy meal with chicken nuggets, yogurt, milk, and fries. And I bought myself a quarter pounder for $4, I think it should be a lil lower than that if I'm just buying the burger."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast on a Saturday morning. The drive-thru was crazy busy! \n\nWe went inside, and got our food quickly and efficiently. Quality was good, and the lobby was clean. As good as it gets for McDonald's grub!"}
{"text":"I just came back from here. The drive thru was crazy, of course because of the time (1130). \n\nThere was a young employee setting up an umbrella and a sign. He was the ONLY one who was nice, which you would think, in this heat, he would be a little snappy.\n\nThe other two employees I greeted, said \"hello\" to, asked them how they were. No response.\n\nUnreal. But my order was right."}
{"text":"I could have sworn that I wrote a review for this McD's already.  Oh well, here it goes.\n\nIt's McDonald's, what can I say?  This location recently went through a major overhaul and has been completely remodeled.  Surprisingly, they handled it well.  For awhile the drive thru was totally closed, then the lobby was closed, then both were closed.  They moved quickly and everything is now completed.\n\nI've not ever been in the lobby, so I can't comment on that - but the drive through is nice.  It now has 2 lanes for ordering, which eases some of the congestion and back up that happens at this location.\n\nThe staff I have encountered have always been friendly (considering) and I've not ever had any issues with my food.  I try and stay away from here as much as possible, but it's super convenient if I'm in a rush and starving."}
{"text":"Terrible. Rude. Alecia, the general manager, would not even give me the information for the store for my complaint. They would not accept coupons. They said they were franchise and had a right to refuse. No smiles. Very unfriendly. Look at their reviews. They are obviously onto some terrible service. The manager is staring at me while I am outside in my own vehicle writing this review. This place is a joke!"}
{"text":"Vague memories of stopping in after a get together with friends but had the wrappers (w/ buns cause I eat no bread) and a crumpled up receipt.\n\nMickey D's the processed hamburger version of Starbucks.  As my brother once told me, \"It's better to eat S%&# then not eat anything at all.\""}
{"text":"I understand that this is McDonald's but a person taking an order shouldn't make fun of someone with a speech impediment. My husband was nice enough to order for me which he has worked up to for the last three years because he is very self conscious of his stutter. I used to order everything for us but he has gotten some confidence to place the orders, until tonight... my husband was ordering and he was having pauses between his speech because he was trying to get his words out properly, and this super rude child of a drive through cashier then replies with pauses between his speech.... after my husband finished making fun of how my husband was speaking...I'm disgusted...."}
{"text":"Ya know what you're getting from McDonald's as they have perfected their uniform menu items across all locations..... But this McDonald's seems to screw up my drink order EVERY time in the drive thru. I order a large Dr Pepper and I always get a coke....or a diet something. It's been 4 for 4 since I've been keeping track. I get it, we all make mistakes, but every time?! It just happened again today. I not need to make a mental note to take a sip of my drink before I pull away. Thanks Obama."}
{"text":"On occasion they give good service but for the most part everyones rude and fries are stale. I hate this location and wouldn't come back if it wasn't for my son who of course like many children don't know any better and love McDonald's."}
{"text":"This location is currently undergoing a renovation, so the front counter is closed. The other night I went through the drive through, ordered, and asked for the smoothie deal (buy one get one free, any size) and they told me you had to go to the counter for that. SERIOUSLY? I'm less upset by the fact that I didn't get my smoothie than the simple stupidity of that statement. And this morning, they forgot my drink with my order. And the manager wanted me to drive through again. Seriously? Just get me my chocolate milk dude! And why was I allowed into apparent construction zone?? It's supposed to be closed, there's guys working all over the place, and they let me just walk right through them. In a hoodie, green plaid and Birkenstocks. I did it just to see if they'd let me in. And I stood there for a good five minutes before the manager asked me drive around again. And a couple weeks ago, I found a HAIR IN MY CHIKEN NUGGETS. A black, curly hair. And the manager laughed, and told me I can get anything on the menu. Didn't say a word to anyone working back there! Disgusting. I'm done with this location."}

Do not come here if you plan on staying longer than a half hour - even as a paying customer.\n\nToday, while studying material for medical school, I was kicked out and asked not to come back. Apparently, I was there for too long. In my experience, Cafe and free wi-fi is to attract students/business persons to come, buy their product, study/work, and buy more product. The owner has informed me that no customer, paying or not, is allowed to stay at their facility for longer than a half hour.\n\nThe owner also informed me that my family was not to use the PlayPlace for longer than a half hour - even if we made purchases every half hour.\n\nIf you plan on studying/working, go to to another cafe. I stay at the Starbuck's across the street for hours on end and it seems to \"fit with their business plan\".

{"text":"Yes!  It finally happened with drive thru.  Ok, I just got a mocha frap drink but the kid was so excited since the driver in front of me looked like Rachel Ray I got a smile and I got a really good drink.  I even got a straw too!  I have to give them a thumbs up!  I have to say I love the drink and please don't tell my friends at Starbucks but I like it better than the Mocha Frap there.....shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!  plz don't tell!  :)"}
{"text":"I would never be the person that makes a scene, but i was almost tempted to today. I ordered the chicken nuggets meal and i had eaten four of the chicken nuggets when I looked down and saw a brown, singed hair in my chicken nuggets. I knew this was not my hair because i am blonde. I was completely disgusted and went and nicely told the cashier that there was a hair in my food and i would like a refund. She yelled to her manager that i wanted a refund because there was a hair in my food. Not once did he apologize or offer me anything else. Not that I wanted that, just an apology. He didn't even give me the full refund for my meal. The main thing that upset me was his lack of good customer service and AN APOLOGY. Not surprised though because it is Mcdonalds."}
{"text":"You know I don't write reviews for fast food but I probably should. I mean they are people too and small business owners as well. I come here every now and then during lunch from classes. It is what it is. It's McDonald's. Recently I tried the grilled chicken and it was pretty good. I supersized it for $1 more. Yes, that's right I did the unthinkable and anachronistic ritual of supersizing! Then again I am a buck fifty and 5'7. I can supersize all I want technically. But I only get fries or go to MCD once in a while. More often for a cold drink in summer than eat the food. But this place is clean. It has lots of comfortable tables. The employees are cheery, clean, and hard working. So they should be commended for that. This location looks like a franchisee location. But I have no complaints. Once time some dumb kids took their bikes inside and a mother scolded them and forced them to take their bikes back outside so I can see that families come here as well.\n\nSo for fast food, this is a good location that I've enjoyed coming to through the years even though I don't live here on Horizon anyymore...not for quite a few years."}
{"text":"The reason why the 1-star.... ALWAYS getting our orders wrong OR missing something in our orders!!! Unfortunately, it's the closest to my house & whenever we wanna get a quick bite to eat on our way home from where ever we are, this McD's is just on the way.  There are some workers that are really nice & then theres the ones that don't even acknowledge that you're even there @ the drive thru window for who knows how long! On top of waiting & NO greeting... somethings missing in my bag!!  I normally just do the drive thru's here.  Never ate in here yet so I have no idea how the service is in there.  I've noticed though, they go through a lotta new workers.  My hubby on MANY  occasions would have a messy ass burger.  I mean it literally looks like they slapped on all the meat & cheese like they did it w/ a blindfold & don't even wrap the burgers nicely w/ the wrapper.  Enough to pick up the burger out of the bag & ALL the contents of that burger falls right out! WTH?!?! \n\nI strongly suggest when coming to this location.... CHECK YOUR ORDER before driving away when going through drive thru.  I do even if there's a long line @ the drive thru window."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the slowest McDonald's to exist. They take forever to give out the orders no matter what time of day it is. The line is always long inside and out and it doesn't seem very sanitary. Because it's so convenient, I'll still go here but, they need to improve on their speed."}
{"text":"This Mcdonalds has drastically improved since they put in the new drive-thru system.  I used to have to pull around front everyday and wait extra time for food or coffee.\nThe only real issue I have is that their specialty coffee is never consistent.  It tastes different everytime!"}
{"text":"Needs lots of upgrades. Not as nice as other modern locations.  Service is OK. Place is small. But I prefer the locations that have all the new modern upgrades built in."}
{"text":"Hard for me to rate as I'm a vegetarian...but we took a friends kid here and fed him while we had a shake.  Good service, play area and very clean."}
{"text":"This is the most inefficient McDonalds I have ever been to.   The Manager Mike was chirping out orders to all his little minions.  Mike -- the level of stress you operate at -- you're going to give yourself a heart attack.  Deep breaths.  Bottom of the pot coffee too.    I probably will not return next time I have a craving."}
{"text":"I won't be coming back to this location.  My wife and I wanted to take our daughter to play in the kid's area so we just wanted to get coffee.  The cashier there was not wearing a name tag so I don't know what her name was.  Very unprofessional.  Didn't acknowledge us when we walked in.  She looked annoyed that she had to do her job and all we wanted was coffee.  Her pants were sagging and didn't seem like she wanted to be there.  I understand this is McDonalds and I don't expect top level service but I expect a professional attitude and basic customer service.  She took our order wrong and got annoyed that she had to correct it.  We didn't let her ruin our night but we won't be going back to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"I strongly like this location.  Very clean, well taken care of. I notice people constantly sweeping, mopping, emptying the trashes. I watch them wash their hands.\n\nSome of the staff know exactly how i order my burger. Great customer service. General Manager here is really nice. Always served up hot food because it's inside a Walmart Supercenter. There is NO wifi, drive thru or Playground at this location.\n\n\nThe playground & WiFi location is up the street at Badura AVE. Yelp link below.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-las-vegas-53"}
{"text":"Inside of Walmart so no drive thru. Gets crowded easily, especially with carts in the way. Sticky counters. You don't wanna bump into the trashcans cause they're covered in ketchup. Never have to wait long though and employees are usually pretty nice. Same stuff you'd get at any McD's."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled.  The address isn't to the McDonald's in the photo.  This McDonalds is actually located in the Wal*Mart across the street.\n\nThey used to have workers there that were really unprofessional, but they shaped up their workers recently, I think.  The food is pretty good, can't complain.  Being in a Wal*Mart, they bring out the food pretty fast because it gets pretty busy at certain hours.  I do like this McDonald's and it's good because they're pretty much 24-hours.  Except for that one hour they close at 1am.  ^_^"}
{"text":"Why rate fast food restaurants in the first place? There is no consistency to fast food. It depends on when you go and what you order. Your experience today will differ from your next trip to that restaurant. It's silly to waste time reviewing f/f outlets. Peace out."}
{"text":"It was a McDonald's ... no just a McDonald's, but a McDonald's in a Walmart - it don't get better than this!   We had very good service. Food made \"fresh\" - but the people after us were ignored at the counter.  As for McDonald's, I think this one is not bad - just do not go and expect to feel good later."}
{"text":"This McDonalds has the worst customer service . I asked for a cup of coffee and they had no lids , so the cup was open . And they didn't even bother to look for lids in the back ."}
{"text":"Whatever you do stay out of this McDonalds.  They have the rudest managers.  I went through the drive thru at about 10:00 p.m. 8/18/15 and ordered an ice cream cone.  Not only did the person preparing it have his hands all over my cone (that I have to eat thank you) he made it super small.  Smaller than I ever had and then told me it was the standard size.  I requested a refund. He was so ornery that rather than put more ice cream on the cone he would rather just have to throw the cone away and give me the refund.  That was ridiculous and he was just petty and rude!  Never again!  Go to the one down the street on Blue Diamond and Rainbow.  Hopefully, they are not owned by the same people."}
{"text":"Food was fresh but took a while. I noticed a younger gentleman cleaning the floors when the tables were what needed attention, and booths were dirty! Id say management is at fault and needs to give better direction. Customer service wasn't the friendliest even from the manager herself. Wouldn't be all that excited to dine in here again."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is located inside the Walmart at the Arroyo Crossing shopping center.  Since it's our local Walmart, we pass by this Mickey D's all the time.  More often than not, the Husband convinces me that he's hungry and wants to grab a snack while we're there.  Usually it's something easy like their Hot N Spicy Chicken Sandwich, but other times we've sat down for a full meal.\n\nMy most recent find discovery was during Halloween.  They were selling these Halloween Treat books for $1 each!  Inside were coupons for free apple dippers, free small cones, and free apple juice or milk jugs.  You get a total of 12 coupons for $1!  What a deal!  And what makes this location cooler than others is that they even offered it!  (I tried purchasing more at another location and they didn't offer it!)\n\nOverall, they are pretty efficient and professional than some of the other McDonald's I've been to in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru and was surprised that there was someone there taking orders.  That was totally new to me since In-n-Out does that. Never seen it at McDonald's.  He was friendly and took our order fast and correct. The drive thru lady was friendly.  \n\nThis location has a playground for kids."}
{"text":"This location exclusively has 8pm-4am midnight snack of 6 piece nugget + small fries for $1.99! \n\nThis location is inside the Walmart at Arroyo Crossing. It is probably very convenient and I always fall for the fact that it is in Walmart when I shop here. The staff are very nice and quick about taking the customer's orders and food are always pretty quick. There usually is a line of 1-2 when I visit but that could probably just be the time I get there.\n\nI never had any 'problems' with the food that they 'served' me.\nI think the unique thing was the midnight snack advertisement they have. If you are here between 8PM - 4AM, they have a special of 6 piece chicken nugget + a small fry for 1.99 which is something I never seen advertised at other McDonald places."}
{"text":"Will not return due to the service being bad, my food being wrong, and don't order anything that requires more than one ingredient because they forget all of the important ingredients and mess up the rest. \nI ordered the new frozen strawberry lemonade that is suppose to be made with real strawberries and frozen. But instead I got a frothy, watered down drink. When I asked for a new one, they attempted to make me one but failed and asked if I wanted the new strawberry lemonade over ice instead. I said yes, and waited for this new strawberry lemonade that is suppose to have real strawberries and a lemon slice inside as well. It was worse. There were no strawberries, no lemon wedge, just water crap. I am promising you that I will not return."}
{"text":"Quarter Pounder Sirloin Microwave HEATED !\nBut they're coffee is good, and other drinks"}
{"text":"New management please!! First of all I'm never eating there again. Went through the drivethru today had a simple order. #5 large with Dr. Pepper. ...... Easy right??? WRONG! To my knowledge the premium sandwiches are supposed to be delicious. Pulled up to pay, the girl at the window didn't greet me at all, held out her hand & didn't say a word, then handed back my change, same thing, not a word. Get up to the next window and again not greeted at all by the next employee. She handed me my drink, I asked for a side, she closed the window in my face without acknowledging my request. Comes back to the window hands me the bag & I drive away. The only time anyone spoke to me was when I placed my order. How rude & unprofessional!! I get home, mind you 7 minutes later reach in my bag to grab my fries (a large) which is what I ordered but someone didn't fill the fry carton. It was literally only half way full. No joke. I thought hey people make mistakes, then I grabbed my sandwich box again extremely disappointed. I took a bite and the \"PREMIUM\" bun was as hard as a rock & the chicken was chewy & old perhaps cooked at lunch time & kept in the bin. Not good at all. Never ever ever again will I eat at this place!!!! I paid $8.42 for a fast food meal. It should be what I ordered & should taste good this did not at all. I had another instance before with the store manager of this store, she is extremely rude!!! Contacted the district manager & he is not any better because apparently the first time calling didn't change anything like he said it would. This place deserves no stars at all but I am forced to choose one."}
{"text":"The service is horrible... no one speaks English and all employees are very rude.  I guess that's what you get at McDonalds!"}
{"text":"By far the worst McDonald's. Rude staff, wrong orders and they don't follow the menu combos. I paid extra for hash browns and they're supposed to come with my order. Staff even has the nerve to mutter about you while ur sitting in ur car within hearing distance. I hope that 2.5 million startup was worth hiring someone who doesn't even care about customer service or upholding the name of the supposedly number one chain in America."}
{"text":"Ordered McFlurrys through the drive thru. Paid at the window and was handed the McFlurrys not mixed. I handed them back to the guy and said they need to be mixed. He said they couldn't mix it. Really mcdonalds??? Why even sell them? Or why not tell the person at the order point about it. Major fail. Get your poop in a group McDonalds"}
{"text":"I came on my 30 min lunch break & ordered the #2 meal . I asked that my burgers have no onions, add mayo, & extra pickles. When the order was on screen it only showed 1 burger being ordered that way but the worker said it would be both of them because it was the 2 cheeseburger meal. I got my food & glanced in the bag & saw the grill slip stating the correct way I wanted my burgers so I headed back to work. I started eating my food & first off the fries were very cold & old tasting which is sad considering I work only 1.1 miles from this location but that is what I have come to expect from McDonalds. I then noticed the grill slip on my 2nd burger was not correct. It only said no onions & extra pickle which is fine as its the onions that I absolutely HATE so I take a bite and ONIONS! I spit it out into a napkin & open the burger & it is a regular cheeseburger w/ onions & 1 pickle not the special order as the grill slip indicated. So then I open my other burger which had the correct order on the grill slip & that burger is correct. My receipt was in my truck so I Googled the  # & found 702-457-0488 to call & after ringing for a very long time I get Maria. I have never spoken to a ruder fast food manager. They are usually so nice and accommodating & apologetic. She was the complete opposite. She told me I had to bring the food back & I told her I couldn't today because I was on lunch & it was now almost over. She told me I had to keep the food and bring it back another day. I told her since I ate the 1 burger and fries I probably wouldn't come for a week or so and she said that was OK but, I had to bring the food.  This is absurd! I then asked for the next level managers # & she said the # so fast & then would say OK? that I had to ask her to repeat it 3x! I called that # & got Alejandra who told me the same absurd story of keeping the food until I could come back.  It has been a number of years since I worked for McDonald's but I did for 5 years & I don't see how this could be the policy or even be sanitary to my household or to bring old rotting food into the store!"}
{"text":"4 stars for McDonald but -5 starts for the customer service! The female in blue shirts with lip tattoo on her neck has a b****a** attitude! Avoid this location!!!"}
{"text":"This one is located alongside Terrible's Gas Station, and the Albertson's Shopping Center/strip mall. We go to this one the most (though we really don't eat fast food on  a large scale anyway, ever since, our lifestyle changes), the Drive-Thru window mostly, and on occasion, inside too (clean, locals). This one is about the same distance from our home, as the one at Paradise/Sahara (way more tourists and way more cars at the Drive-Thru too), but this one is less crowded. Inside is a little smaller, than most locations, since it's sharing space with the Terrible's Gas Station and Convenience Mart.\n\nSince we only get three items on the menu, our order's pretty easy (cone sundae, or sandwich), so it's usually right. There are usually a few cars in the Drive-Thru window too, BTW. But it's never too long of a wait. \n\nThe gas station/mini-mart and the whole shopping center is relatively busy during the day."}
{"text":"Extremely dirty place! Don't even think about trying it! From the smell to the floor and the tables! Nor even 1 clean table!"}
{"text":"If you are expecting luxuries like napkins with your order, you're in the wrong place. Ordered two sausage biscuits and a burrito for breakfast, they were out strawberry jam and hot sauce. \n\nStaff are miserable and clearly don't want to be there. It wasn't even that busy but service was mediocre."}
{"text":"A McDonalds review? Yep. Because when all else fails it's really hard for someone to mess up a Big Mac. This location has a drive through that's not that bad to get through and usually moves fast at peak times. If you look through the drive through window or walk inside you'll notice it's kept clean. \n\nThis McDonalds has kept me from being hungry when Lotus of Siam and Komol messed up my lunch more than once. And to be honest this review is just my way of saying thank you for being there as I know with a quick run through the drive through I won't be going back to work hungry."}
{"text":"Public area is dirty. Whats really bad is that a homeless community has been set up in the parking lot. Literally! And when you try to wslk in, they all hit you up for money. Go in to order you food and the homeless are in the store too. Sitting at the tables and asking for money or eating the food people dont finish. If you go yo this location? Use the drive thru. Who ever owns this shopping center needs to deal with this homeless camp."}
{"text":"Worst location ever!! They are always out of things. Biscuits, apple pie...etc. The staff is a joke! They always sound miserable & NEVER get an order right. I know its not a gourmet restaurant but come on have some damn pride!! They never give ket hup, forget straws & can't even wish me a good day! That is why machines will take over your job!"}
{"text":"Between two shows last night, I had about 45 minutes to kill so I drove the short distance here to get a McFlurry.  For me, McDonald's has become a place to get a  side salad or a quick dessert.  Dessert it was.\n\nThe drive through was packed, so I parked at the convenience store parking and went inside.  The staff was very friendly.  The only issue I had was with adding to my Arch card account.  They couldn't remember how to do it.  After awhile, a light bulb went off and I had some money loaded on the card.\n\nI got my Oreo McFlurry and I sat in the restaurant to enjoy it.  It was good--typical McDonald's--it's the same at each location.  The restaurant was relatively clean.  There was a table that needed clearing but other than that, it was neat.  There's also free wifi which made checking my email a breeze.  It was very snappy.\n\nThere are some pictures on the walls that look like they are made of jigsaw puzzle pieces. One was of Ray Croc.  I couldn't tell if they were real puzzle pieces or if the art had been designed to just look that way.\n\nI'll be back when I'm in the area of Commercial Center and need a soft ice cream fix."}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 Star I would. Isn't McDonald's supposed to be improving their accuracy of drive thru orders? Doesn't seem like it. On many occasions, at this location they've forgotten items that I've ordered. Aggravating cause those are things payed for. The last straw was when I ordered a couple of cheeseburgers and fries and once I got home and ready to eat, to my surprise no patty's, or whatever that is, just the buns! Pathetic!"}
{"text":"If I could rate this zero stars I would, this is by far the worst McDonald's. The service is really crapy, they are very rude and take a very long time to make the food the employees are the worst. \n\nThere was a time when they charged me 3 times more then what I asked for, another time they forgot the bun, and most of the time I go there they mess up my order the only reason I go there is when I absolutely have no choice, I do not recommend this McDonald's at all and I believe this is the worst McDonald's in the whole Las Vegas Nevada."}
{"text":"This was the longest wait in a drive thru ever.  Seriously it was about 15 minutes. I have never had an experience like this ever at a fast food location.  When I finally pulled up to the window they said they were having computer problems.  Very frustrating.  I do not prefer McDonald's at all but some how the kids like."}
{"text":"The night employees from this particular mcdonalds are VERY RUDE!! I feel they don't care about the customers! And not only they make you wait a ridiculous amount of time but also are very careless! I don't recommend this mcdonalds! !!!"}
{"text":"If i could rate it as a zero i would.... Rocks are smarter than the people who work in this dump!"}
{"text":"Dunno what's up with today. Drive thru was taking much longer than normal. Handed me wrong food at first (understandable this one sorta was busy), but then handed me my drinks in wrong sizes. Both of which tasted awful (need to check their ratio in the machines again.)\n\n......meh. Gave them an extra star just because the two people were being polite at least. If it woulda taken longer or my bag had the wrong food then it woulda been less."}
{"text":"Total crap, you're in the middle of a major city and you have no fountain drinks available ? NOT ACCEPTABLE! I expected more from you. Throughly disappointed. 30 minute lunch break ruined! Thanks for failing at the ONE thing your establishment is meant to do. Good riddance."}
{"text":"This review is a little over a year late, but its well deserved!!\n\nMy husband and I were in Las Vegas for our honeymoon in June of 2013. On our way out of town we decided to stop at this McDonald's. My husband and I both ordered the double quarter pounder combo. \n\nThey were so good that my husband STILL talks about it. Every time we go to a McDonald's in California, where we live, he always compares it back to this location's food.\n\nThe woman who took our order, I clearly remember because she was so happy!! She was an older woman who greeted us as soon as we pulled up, told us to take our time, we pull up to the window and she greets us there with a huge smile and asking us how we are. I wish we had gotten her name or I saved the receipt because she was just the nicest woman ever!! \n\nThe food was completely cooked, not under or over cooked. The hamburgers were hot, the french fries were actually cooked the right way, none were soggy and none were too hard. \n\nGreat food and great customer service!!\n\nAlso, when we stopped in Barstow on our way home, my husband turned to me and told me, \"I want to turn around and go back to McDonald's in Las Vegas!!\" Hahahaha"}
{"text":"Make sure you ask for napkins at the drive thru!!!  The morons working the window haven't figured out that drive thru customers might want napkins with their order yet."}
{"text":"13 minutes in the drive-thru, unacceptable. Having to repeat my order 3 times, unacceptable. \n\nThese people think they deserve $12/hr?? Lmao, shouldn't even be making minimum wage."}
{"text":"It's just like all McDonald's but why did I give it 4 stars?  Because I've never had a problem at this place.  This McDonald's is clean, neat and friendly.  Even the playroom is nice.  When they happen to get my order wrong, they right it fast and apologize nicely.  They even ask if we'd rather keep the wrong item since they have to throw it out anyways.  I LOVE this McDonald's!!!"}
{"text":"They offer semi truck parking. But don't expect to order thru the drive thru after the lobby is closed. They don't serve walk ups. Guess they need to think about the drive thru height to accommodate us truck drivers. Zero stars if it was a option"}
{"text":"The food was predictable, not bad. The older woman working the counter was as nasty as she could be. No name tag, of course, but I will submit a comment on the corporate website. I realize it's a fast food place, but that level of rudeness is uncalled for. Sheesh."}
{"text":"Another busy fast food restaurant on the Streetsboro strip. Clean location, friendly service.  Has an indoor playground.  OK choice if you need your McD fix."}
{"text":"Terrible service 3 people standing around while I waited for a sundae trash overflowing in kids area and gnats and fly's all over"}
{"text":"I can't give this place few enough stars. Ordered the Southwest Salad, no cheese, no chicken, at 15:56. At 16:04, I received a Southwest Salad with cheese. 8 minutes (wasn't timing, photos are time-stamped) to get some salad, and unfortunately, cheese. I asked for some nuts, the only thing at McDonald's I can eat with protein, and they charged me $1.50 for 5 sliced almonds. I did not receive these. The only decent person was Ambers (I believe), who was very friendly and polite. In the ten minutes I waited, we chatted and she have me a lot of peanuts and fruit- I imagine my face was pretty clear how I felt, and she truly cared about how frustrated I was. \n\nAs I waited, they made the salad a second time, and did no cheese, but did chicken. Ambers saw, and they made it a third time. No acknowledgement, no sorry, no anything. Ambers was polite, but otherwise there was nothing. The cashier cared, but even the manager (or whoever was the leadership role) was just screaming in the back. I have had issues here before I Yelped, but there will NOT be a follow up review."}
{"text":"Great play place!  Video games too."}
{"text":"Loved it as a kid, but over the years the service has been getting worse and worse, same with the food preparation. Last time I went there I ended up getting food poisoning. So yea, not going to visit here anymore."}
{"text":"I try to avoid this location if I can.  I have visited here many times and most of the time my order is incorrect or missing items.  I have gone through the drive through many times and on a few occasions I sat there waiting to be acknowledged, after a few minutes I have to try and get their attention.  The only time I get good service is during breakfast hours on the weekdays.  I have encountered some employees at the drive through during the evening that seems like they don't care about their job, I would pull up and they hand me my order and close the window without even saying a word to me."}
{"text":"Oh McDs.. I have a love/hate relationship with you. Why do you taste so yummy and yet make me feel so gross? What makes it even worse is that this location has a walk-thru window! (All my childhood dreams of walking through a drive-thru have materialized).\n\nSome Guilty Pleasures\n- Smartie McFlurry\n- chicken nuggets\n- bacon cheese burger\n- hash browns\n- fries\n- strawberry sundae\n- $1 drinks\n\nmhmmm... yumm"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I haven't eaten here. Except for a cinnamon roll once a few years ago. I mainly hit them up for coffee, particularly when they're doing a free small coffee promotion. As far as it goes though, this one is fine. It can get busy at peak times being in a prime location near OCAD, and the line-ups can get long. At these times it becomes obvious how small it is. They're really under pressure! Outside of these periods though, the staff are pretty friendly and quick. The manger served me a few times and was particularly pleasant. I'm a bit of a sucker for good customer service!"}
{"text":"- helpful staff, sometimes unfriendly/rushed but there are a LOT of people waiting usually- expect long lines most of the time\n- no free refills on pop at this location\n- pretty standard McD's experience"}
{"text":"This McDonald's recently upgraded to a McCafe.\nbut that's about it.\nService-wise it's very inconsistent. On a good day, the service is what you can normally expect from a McD. (just on par?)\nsome times it will be items being missed on orders or mix-up that just bad.\n(ie. order a Jr. Chicken, end up cooking up a full sized McChicken and wants to charge you more for it. OR ordered a drink, the drink arrives but with no straw for you.)\n\nalso, their Iced Coffee are inconsistent too, sometimes too sweet, while some day it's like coloured milk."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is located in the Village by the Grange foodcourt, by OCAD and the Art Gallery of Ontario. It's one of the rare franchises that offers its patrons the pleasure of a walk up window. It's very much pointless for three reasons: \n\n1) it is not very much effort at all to enter the food court and access their counter from the inside, \n\n2) the WUW offers no additional amenities beyond being served inside. It's not open late, nor it is faster, cheaper, or easier and, \n\n3) it's actually a worse experience since none of the employees take the walk up window that seriously. \n\nToo often I have seen people waiting at the window trying to get the attention of the staff inside. The staff, to their credit, are trying to deal with the longest line in the food court (sad, but true) and I'm sure it messes up production to deal with a loner standing on the opposite side of a glass door. I'd pretend I can't hear him either. My first quicktip for you: NEVER use the walk up window.\n\nMy quick tip the second, don't eat here. Seriously. Don't believe me? They have posted the nutritional information for all to see. (OK, a cheeseburger isn't that bad.)\n\nObligatory Title Pun: This place makes me GRIMACE.\n\nMenu Readability: They actually just revised the menu to be more black, sleek and modern. Lipstick on a pig, y'all.\n\nNeed to mention: You need to try the sous vide. To die for!\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: 'tis a curse to live anywhere near a McDs."}
{"text":"Gosh I remember when you could go to mcdonalds and get a fairly ok meal for like 3 dollars. Today they like to think of themselves as hip slick and cool pawning off god knows what kinda meat that is. This was the absolute WORST visit I have ever made to McDonalds. I was in a rush wanted to grab something quick as i was already late for a meeting about 1 minute away. I pull up order cant understand a word through the universal translator.I pull up and this kid was on drugs or is a paint huffer on the reg. Takes him about 3 minutes to figure my correct total and order at the window. I pull up wait another 8 minutes and am handed the wrong order. Then I am told to pull around to the front and wait for \"fresh\" fries. Pull to front,15 minutes later i get out of my car to get my order and it is coming out. I ask for ketchup and pepper,sorry sir we are out of both...WTF? you guys have one job make sure there are basics to accompany that nasty food you serve so i don't feel as though i'm eating a dog shit sandwich. Anyways,I get to my destination sure the fries were lava hot and my big mac was an fing train wreck. Cold,tasted like total crap I suspect it been sitting there since the last ice age. and to complete my abused visit I felt like i was gonna hurl afterwards. Nice going mcdonalds you guys sure have increased you're value and over all quality. i would not serve this slop to my worst enemy that would be inhumane. take a guess when i will return. Oh and what should have taken 5 minutes turned into 30."}
{"text":"Place is a fucking joke... It takes 5 minutes to order and I came here 3 days in a row... Poor staff n whack ass management. Fries are always cold... Close down already pathetic shit hole."}
{"text":"ANOTHER WRONG ORDER - Not just one mistake or even two - THREE mistakes including being shorted on one item AND WORST OF ALL the Manager filled our order. This will certainly be our last visit to this McDonalds even with the grandkid begging...This store just does not care!"}

{"text":"No stars if I could. How is the ice cream machine broken in June in Vegas. Unacceptable. 3rd time this week and it's Wednesday."}
{"text":"I visited this location this morning at 10:05 am. I attempted to use my 2 for 1 coupon. The manager (Ebony is her name) said, no, you can't use this. It's only for lunch. This is NOT TRUE. It's not that, it's her condescending, rude behavior. Immediately turning around and walking off. I canceled the order. I asked for the corporate phone number from the window employee. I was given a receipt with the LOCAL store address and phone number. They would not answer the phone either. I called the 800 number for McDonald's. They took the report. They will forward the information locally. I drove to another store down Sahara. They had NO ISSUE with the coupon. If your in the area, drive on to another location. Now that I have read other reviews, I should have. I notice the overall score for this location is poor here. I can see why with managers like Ebony working there."}
{"text":"If I could give a -5 stars I would everyone is very rude and look like they don't even want to take my order and the food is beyond terrible I would rather eat horse shit than this garbage"}
{"text":"I kept an open mind coming here with my kids. All the reviews were so bad. So i checked it out myself. Its all true. This place is very nice looking on the outside but on the inside is disgusting. All the tables are dirty and sticky. No one greets you when you come in. All the workers look pissed off. Not a friendly face in here at all. Plus this place is all out of toys and coffee. Our order was old and looked liked it was made for someone else. How is that possible? We wont be back. Ill travel to the other side of the city ti get good quality service."}
{"text":"Why are the iced coffee cups smaller in this store than every other McDonald's yet the price is still the same?!?! Not impressed! :/"}
{"text":"My coworker got us lunch from this branch and were disgusted with the quality of their fries. We got 4 combos and NONE of us were able to eat it. Sadly we couldn't return them because we had to get back to work DISAPPOINTED because we didn't get to enjoy our fries since they were old/oily/stale/ and plain gross! \n\nOn a separate visit, I asked the drive though cashier for ketchup and was told that \"we are all out\" when there was a whole bunch on their counter! I mean, seriously???? \n\nZERO STARS, go to a different mcdonalds!"}
{"text":"I am just going to stop eating here period. They won't see one red cent from me ever again. I'd rather drive out of my way than go to this McDonald's. Every time I try to order from there it's always some issue. They are always out of something, some machine is down, AND at midnight they shut the whole system down and won't even take orders for 20-30 minutes while their system reboots. How stupid do you have to be to do that at MIDNIGHT IN LAS VEGAS, when you're supposed to be a 24 hour store?!? Midnight is still early for Vegas, I'd suggest these morons do their system shut down at 3 or 4 AM. Tonight they were out of the Shopkins Happy Meal toys for girls. And instead gave me a \"girls\" Nerf toy. The whole reason we went to McDonald's to get a Happy Meal was for the Shopkins toy & this ghetto McDonald's can't even have the toys that are advertised nationally as being in the Happy Meals, in stock. Yet their sign shows the Shopkins toys. False advertising! I understand that every place runs out of stock sometimes but this is a regular occurance with this place. I feel the employees, especially the management are just LAZY, incompetent, DON'T CARE, and don't want to do their jobs. In that case, I don't want to give them my money ever again. Congrats Rainbow McDonald's, you've lost a customer. I will never come back there again & will drive out of my way to go to a different McDonald's that actually has competent, hardworking staff."}
{"text":"The grease needs to be changed! It's a dark brownish color, I know because it oozed out of the hash browns. @__@\n My moms a freak, we all know that, but they pushed her over the edge by not having drinks ready until after the food.

{"text":"-0 for everything!!\nTHE worst experience at fast food place, what a joke!!!!!\n\nPulled up to the drive thru behind a 5 car lane.\nIt literally took about 20 mins for each car to pull up and move forward!\n\nMy turn came.. Started ordering..\nGuy disappears .... 10 mins later says \"Hello?!\" rudely!\nOnly to get what I was saying wrong.\nOrdered a McMuffin, Kids Meal, Fries and two coffees.. Waited another 5 mins by the paying window.\n\nSame employee opens the window, gave him my card, then he says \"we cannot accept card payments at the moment\". I asked him, obviously with the little patience I already had, where did it say they were not accepting card payments, or why did they not mention it upon pulling up to the drive thru BEFORE taking the order?!? \n\nHe goes to get the manager, she says the same thing, so I said the same thing! They couldn't say anything else besides they couldn't take cards. No apologies or anything for not having a sign up nor warning people before.\n\nAND these are the people who complain about minimum wage.. PSHHHH.. \nReally hate to complain about a silly fast food place, but a little professionalism and kindness goes a long way!"}
{"text":"I never bother to write reviews for fast food chains, but this might actually be the worst McDonald's in the nation. Long story short, if you don't care about the details, go to the McD on Buffalo and Charleston instead. \n\nFor those that do care about the details, here it goes. I've used to live in this area, and my office is right across the street, so in moments of desperation, usually every few months, I will come to this location. Every time I come, I hope that they've made the proper changes to fix all of their problems with staff, quality and cleanliness. Every time I leave, I realize how dumb I was to try it out again.\n\nFirst off, the Coca Cola has never tasted right. I'm talking since 2008, this location has NEVER had a proper tasting Coke. It tastes like one of their employees accidentally plugged in a Dr. Pepper and they never bothered to clean the line. If they did clean it, then they immediately made the same mistake again. All of their Coke has the same hint of root beer/bubble gum flavor, and never has the right levels of carbonation or syrup.\n\nSecondly, the fryer oil is disgusting. That's why your fries and nuggets are dark brown instead of golden and taste burned. I guarantee that this location does NOT change their fryer oil as frequently as they should. \n\nThirdly, I'm pretty sure this location is where McD sends all of their worst employees. Think of every incompetent person you've ever had give you the wrong order. They all now work at this location. No ketchup? Try extra ketchup. No pickles? How about one pickle hidden in the exact center of the burger. Special order? Good luck getting even half of it right. \n\nNow, I understand that McD is never going to be great, but if you look at the other locations in town, they average about 3 stars. This place is at 1 1/2 stars for a reason. They need to clean house, and I mean literally clean the entire building. Then fire everyone who works there and start again from scratch."}
{"text":"This is the worst McDonalds I have ever been to. I have come here twice and each time they mess up my order. They can't speak English which is probably why they can't get my order right.

The cashiers first name of tanya was extremely polite got my order perfectly correct and I could hear in the background her checking the orders.

Normally every time I go to McDonalds I get the wrong order or I get cheese when I don't want cheese I'd like the 5 stars to go to Tanya for doing such an awesome job."}

Disappointment!\n\nThe side salad was just what I wanted to take home and I was out and on my way quickly.\n\nThis is a bit out of the way because you have to go north of Sahara to get to it and then back to go west on Sahara.\n\nThis is a backup outlet only if I'm in the area."}

{"text":"Drive thru was a bit slow. We wanted something code to drink after standing in the sun at a boyscout popcorn booth. The shakes were made to perfection but my kid got cheated out of two nuggets ( not cool). \n\n(Side Note) I absolutely hate it when you have to park after going through a drive-thru and get out to right a wrong. \n\nAny who... I went inside and the manager was working the register. He just gave me a 4 pack of nuggets with no questions asked. That was nice of him and it instantly calmed my nerves. Everything else was prepared well."}

If you're store is gonna suck this bad you guys should at least make it right, maybe staff your place more, or hire people who can actually work correctly. I wish there was a way to give this place 0 stars they don't even deseve the one star."}
{"text":"Thee most incompetent staff of all time. After I ordered food I remembered I needed a gift card. I asked if I could purchase one and they said they don't take a credit cards--after I just paid with a card. And I asked to order inside and then I'll come in and pay, they said I couldn't. Wth!? What business doesn't want to make money or make their customer happy? And to top it off my order was wrong! Way to try to ruin my day"}

I came last night at 12:25 AM and waited at the drive thru for about 5 minutes then circled the place to find that one of the workers was in the lobby on his phone with his headset on the table. I then went to the drive thru once again having to knock on both window one and two but no answer. Circled one more time to see a line form and I had to get out of my car and knock on the lobby window for him to stare at me. DO YOUR JOB. Don't give me an excuse like you didn't realize it was turned off when you saw my car circling the place. I came to find that there was actually two workers there and he said \"you were waiting for a long time huh?\" And didn't even apologize. Left this place at 12:45"}

After having my ear drums blown out and insides massaged by decibels equal to that of fighter jet engines, myself and a buddy were famished.  Where to go that was basically in same parking lot?  Where to go that one could get the same kind of meal that your could in 1981?  McDonalds was the order of the day.  Nothing spectacular just the same A-OK chow you got when your a child.  Quick drive-thru, basic service, same old consistent chow.  Just what you have come to expect from the golden arches."}
{"text":"walked the entire strip, 2.7 miles and come here for a 6am breakfast, the service is horrible. and their ketchup has gone bad!!!!! dont come here!"}
{"text":"Come on McDonalds, you can do better than that!  Last week I ordered an Egg white Delight and got a regular Egg Mc Muffin, today I ordered an Egg Mc Muffin and Got a Sausage mc muffin with egg. Not sure if they just throw whatever has been sitting there the longest into your bag or what."}
{"text":"Ahhhh artery clogging McDonalds how I semi like thee! I LOVE their sweet tea, with lemon! Its a deal for only 1 dollar for a large!! Also, their play place is pretty rad! My son likes it anyway... I like it when the mosters actually have socks on!\n\nI also like the hazelnut iced coffee and love the fries!"}
{"text":"This place is close to where I hang out. I just want a new clubhouse meal w/crispy chicken. Why did the cashier ask me what number is that. Why did I not get what I ask for and everybody looks at like I have three heads. Sorry to disturb you and the drink station is infested with ants. Yeah not going to be back. \n\nHad to go to the bathroom and that was a mistake. Looks like the place wasn't clean in months happy my kids were not with me. \n\nThe garbage was overflowing but no lines in drive-thru no ppl waiting upfront"}
{"text":"It feels weird reviewing a McDonalds again, but here we go anyway. Unfortunately I've only had the pleasure of visiting this location after hours and have had different experiences each time. \n\nSometimes they allow me to order select breakfast items off of their 24 hour breakfast menu, and sometimes they don't. \n\nSometimes they allow me to pay with my debit card and sometimes they don't.\n\nSometimes the drive thru is open and sometimes the entire restaurant is closed with no warning save for traffic cones blocking the drive thru.\n\nIn case you haven't noticed a pattern, this is the most inconsistent fast food joint I've hit up. And if you do end up ordering some food late at night,  be prepared to take a mini siesta in your car while you wait for your food order."}
{"text":"This is the worse McDonald's in the city. I try to avoid this place as much as possible but when I have my niece and nephews it's unavoidable. So I go through the drive-thru window and I purposely order my chicken McNuggets first and asked for sweet sour because for some reason sweet sour at this location is non-existent, sure enough they don't fail no sweet sour grrrrr. No problem, I always have sweet sour at home. This is not the primary issue I have with this place. It's the employees, they're so miserable. There is no greeting, it's can I take your order pffft good job, as I'm telling the rocket scientist behind the speaker my order she interrupts, asking if I want anything else hmmm we all know how frustration that is. She gives me the total, mind you my order never came up and that menu board to verify anything. I pull up to the window and wait at least 8-10 minutes before this person opens the window, gives me the total and is talking to me with her back towards me. I can barely hear what she is saying, so on a prayer I give her enough change because we don't want them to go on strike or worse reprimand us, believe me I've had some heated exchanges with them. You don't want that because misery loves company. After she hands me the items she just closes the window on me ooooooo and guess we're finished."}
{"text":"Got stuck in the drive thru because a line formed behind me and was there more than 10 minutes just to find out they didn't have any ice cream at 7pm. 3rd time disappointed by this location. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Thank you for wasting my money and time! You guys have me one sausage egg mcmuffin and a sausage mcmuffin for my order of two egg mcmuffins! Didn't even find out about it until after I left! Really guys? How was the order so wrong????"}
{"text":"Seriously the worst Mc Donald's in the world. The customer service doesn't even deserve a 1 star. The drive thru takes forever, they give you wrong orders, flat soda, and an attitude when you talk to them about it. Overall, it doesn't deserve any stars. But the employees...not worth going ever again."}
{"text":"Had to wait almost 10 minutes in my car after ordering at drive-thru, because food wasn't pre-cooked.  They supersized my fries, and gave me two apple pies for my trouble.  How cool is that?"}
{"text":"Usually come here during my breaks to get an iced coffee or a meal but damn are they SLOW! I dont come during rush hour or anything. Usually there's only one person running the whole thing and another just standing there."}
{"text":"I don't write many useful things, but I hope this review will be a useful deterrent if something ever possesses you to even think about coming here. I hate McDonald's in general anyways so I know I'm heavily biased but I can't keep my virtual mouth shut about this particular location. The only reason why I'm admitting to coming here enough to write this review is to do my good deed for the day and warn people.\nEverything is ghetto about this location. The staff, the customers, the service, everything. Even the wifi seems ghetto. My guess is that upon entering, you will have a mixture of feelings that involve uncomfortableness, frustration, and even a bit of fear. You WILL run into the ghetto fabulous princess who thinks she can get extra cheeseburgers for free because she has 4 kids with her. You WILL have to wait in line for this because they will never have more than one person service. You WILL have to wait an unusually long time for your food to come out even after you order. You WILL wish you took your food to go. You WILL wish you never used the restrooms here. You WILL understand why they lock the door from the outside for the entrance facing Rainbow. I won't go on and on about this, so I will conclude with this:\nThere is really no reason to come to this particular location, especially considering the fact that there is another McDonald's less than half a mile away on Sahara just east of this location."}
{"text":"It's a McDonalds and thus there is not much to say here. Premises are kept clean, never had an experience with drive through but at the counter service has been polite and food has come out at fast-food speeds. It is the frequent drunken food binge spot of teenagers after the midnight hour, and can be loud and and a little disorganized at this time. It is extremely well decorated for some reason and boasts some of the best seating I've seen in a McDonalds."}
{"text":"Prices continue to rise at McDonald's or as they would prefer to be called McCafe. They have added touch screens and laid off staff. Offer to carry your food in an attempt to make poor quality and higher prices some how more valuable. Come on its McDonald's we understand and continue to go even though Ronald has been dead for years. \nThis location is no better or worse than any other but let's stop pretending to be something that you are not.\nA Big Mac is no longer big.\n What other company charges for condiments? \nWhy is food served warm, not hot? \nA decent burger and fries with a drink served fresh and hot should be $14.00. \nThat does not include anything at McDonald's.  \nToday we went and ordered lunch for three adults. \nOne order of fries were hot. The other two not even warm. .the quarter pounder was  small and lame, a tiny piece of lettuce and three tiny onions.\nThe McChicken was like rubber. Should we be surprised? It's our own fault and what we have come to expect from McDonald's.  \nI complained. \nThe customer care specialist spoke to us, she was nice but had no answers, no offers and explained that she would speak to the manager for us. She could not do anything for us as she did not work for the restaurant but traveled around for McDonald's head office. We were offered a bigger Burger at a higher price,I could add more lettuce or onions at a higher price. If I wanted a better meal I could order an Angus it's far  more expensive but has a bit of quality. \nLet me get this straight if I buy the biggest highest quality burger at the highest price I may get some value or something close to a decent lunch? \nI laughed and asked for my money back. \nBasically the McDonald's quality specialist told us that the food is crap and even the most expensive meal on the menu is not much better. \nI don't think that was her intent but that is clearly the message we got. As for a refund I got the lowest price I could have paid. \nEven though we did not use a two can dine coupons because the phone app was not working they gave me half of the two can dine price . I did not notice until we had already left. \nNeedless to say we will not be back."}
{"text":"This location is by far the worst one in town!!! I have visited here on several occasions and each time the ice cream machine is broken!!! It can't just be coincidence that EVERYTIME I go buy buy a mc flurry or a cone that the machine is down!!! Come on?!?!?  FIX the darn thing already!!!"}
{"text":"McLobster is McLousy!  If I had not had another lobster sandwich or sub, I would still conclude that this is pretty weak. However, since having Quiznos' Lobster sub, the difference is stark.\n\nThe McLobster lacks flavor, color and appeal.  In contrast, the Quiznos product is sweet, salty, and flavorful. \n\nAnother difference is the heft--McLobster is half the size of the medium sub at Quiznos for about the same price.\n\nI was sure that I was being too critical, having eaten an Australian lobster for $200 at the Ambassador, but after eating the McLobster, I immediately drove over to Quiznos and ordered their lobster sub. It was superior in every way, especially construction. \n\nMy McLobster was not even assembled. Someone just threw a scoop of the fishy mix on one end of a hot dog bun and shut the lid. \n\nAnd value?  For $2 more I can get a Quiznos large sub that is twice the size of Mickey's mess. Sorry, Charlie..."}
{"text":"I feel sorry for the staffs at this McDonald's because off all the changes and lack off training which is shown in the service here .. Head office need to come back down and retrain how operations need to be . This not the only McDonald's location having this issue it all over Newmarket . If want service you need to get it outside off the town or just avoid eating McDonald's all to getter !"}
{"text":"This McDonald's is at the intersection of Eagle and Yonge street in newmarket and IT IS TERRIBLE!!!  DO NOT USE THEIR DRIVE-THRU!!! We live around the area and have gone there several times for a drive-thru order. 9 times out of 10 they get the order wrong. We will not be returning to this McDonald's anymore. The buns on the burgers are dry and there was one time where we got iced teas for our drive-thru order and it looked like iced tea, but it tasted like water, so we weren't sure what we were drinking. There is another McDonalds just north of Davis by Canadian Tire, go to that one instead."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 3 different times and ordered 2 double cheeseburgers all 3 times and it was beyond terrible. Cold patties, cheese not melted, carelessly thrown together burgers, fries taste like they have been sitting for days. McDonald's is never expected to be the caviar of food but I would at least expect some sort of quality. If there was an option for 1/2 of a star I would do it."}
{"text":"Worst McDonalds I've ever been to. I work near by and a few times a month I go through the drive-thru for breakfast. The food is typical McDonalds food but the customer service is horrible. It is truly the worst customer service of any place I've been to. The only reason I go there is its near my office. But after years of dealing with the horrible customer service I'm not going back. Don't go there. There are other fast food places on Elliot Rd."}
{"text":"I came here because it is close to the Nissan dealership. First thing I noticed is that it smelled like the toilets had backed up. Next they didn't have sweet tea in the lobby which is fine since they said bring the cups back up to them and they would fill it. But then we were told to wait and they would bring tea out front. We waited for the tea for like 5 minutes and this is during lunch. Just seems like by lunch they would have this all figured out. They have a decent size lobby to sit and eat at but unfortunately they have poor seating that makes it difficult to find a seat. Not overall impressive for a newer location."}
{"text":"I've been to this McDonald's twice now and the service is fast, friendly, and fantastic! Their employees are very helpful and make sure your order is complete and correct before they hand it over to you. \n\nI recommend giving this location a try if you haven't yet. The experience is well worth it!"}
{"text":"I Showed up last night for lunch break which was 30 minutes only to wait for my hash browns. For a FULL 30 minutes. I paid but I drive off and left because I was late for work BUT that doesn't matter anyway. I got fired. For $10 that I never got back and food I never got."}
{"text":"So I went to this McDonald's location this morning. Service speed is fine...so I order an egg Mcmuffin and hash brown total 3.88. Cool I hand the girl 3 dollar bills, 3 quarters, a dime and 3 pennies total equals 3.88. Waiting for her to count it and drove to the next window. The manager/supervisor comes running to the window, says I was short 20cents on my order I gave him 20cents as I don't find it something to argue about its 20cents. So I pull off grab my hashbrown from the bag it's old and cold smh. Atleast if you are going to complain about a petty 20 cents and run to the window, I would think you would make sure my food is fresh or hot. I think anyone would agree."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! Are you kidding me kids? I ordered an egg white delight and literally got a sliver of egg white and the English muffin is burnt. I'm done. Going to Dunkin Donuts from here on out. The quality is poor, service is slow and I am not sure they've ever managed to get my order right!"}
{"text":"I get it, it's McDonalds. You don't want to work there, especially at 5 am. But it's not hard to fake it. Annunciate your words. If you can't do that at least give me a receipt so I know how much you just charged me. At the very least, know the difference between bacon and sausage. Horrible location."}
{"text":"This McDonalds has very poor service. The employees seemed like they did not want to work there at all. Food sometimes takes quite some time to come out. I go here since it is right next to work and is very close. Other coworkers also complain about this McDonalds not being that great and recommended me to actually go out of my way to a different place to get breakfast."}
{"text":"I had an awesome experience today. The service was friendly, fast. I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"This location is 24 hours and is one of the newer and cleaner places. Also conveniently located near an interstate exit."}
{"text":"Visited this location last Saturday, and received repulsive customer service from \"Odalyis,\" who took several minutes to come to the pay window, and once she did, asked us to pull around the front and wait for our order of ONE FRENCH FRY. After asking why we had to wait, and why she didn't come to the window, her excuse was she \"didn't know which order we were.\" Not only did she make no sense, but she was also very rude and hostile, lacking expected customer service skills at any modern establishment. After she realized she had nothing valid to say, she walked away, then returned with our bag, and in the process, dropped my change on the ground and our receipt was ripped in half, which contained her name and our order. Horrid wait times, and even poorer employees. Will not be returning because I prefer not to spend my money on the likes of prideful snots."}
{"text":"Go to this McDonalds just cause its next to work.  Service is slow...  everyone seems like they don't want to work there.  Even the supervisor doesn't even want to take orders.  Hashbrown taste like a filot fish.  Even drive-thru takes forever."}
{"text":"Slowest.... McDonald's..... Ever.... With two drive-thru you would think that this would go a lot faster. I'm very rational about waiting, but what bothers me the most is a type of customer service. Better training is needed. Otherwise great design."}
{"text":"Lets clear some stuff first... I love McDonalds...lol Its cheap and fills the tummy :D\n\nNow that's clear lets talk about this location. The location is quite big and has lot of seating. I have used both inside service and drive through and the customer service has been good and quite fast.\n\nThe draw back on the other was lot of kids hog the place in evening so its not pleasant to seat there and relax over a meal. Also at one point I need a plug to charge my laptop and I could not find one at this location.\n\nI have seen cops visiting this place quite frequently, I think to keep things calm down as there is lot high school kids around."}
{"text":"This location is interesting. My sister and I went through drive thru and ordered 10 nuggets with small fries. We told the employee that we have a Monopoly sticker/coupon to redeem our free small fries and in return she said: \"We can't do that at drive thru. We normally don't do it, but I'll let it pass for today.\" Huh? I don't get it. No where on any of the McDonald's Monopoly advertisements does it say that they are unable to redeem Monopoly coupons through drive thru. \nThe total came up to $7.93. We gave her $20.93 and the change we got back was $10.93. Once again... HUH? I don't get it. Either this employee is new, lazy or she sucks at multitasking. It took her quite some time to give us our order. She added a straw to the bag even though we didn't order a drink. She looked pissed off too (unless of course that's just her natural look)\n\nI don't mind McDonald's in general. The only thing that turns me off about it is certain locations I go to. This location is weird. The staff is odd. This is the third time I had a problem at this location."}
{"text":"Service here is alright, decent parking lot, but sometimes they can take forever to prepare a McCafe drink. I ordered a cappucino this afternoon and found it odd how the cashier started making it.  Usually it's punched into the computer/cash and someone else prepares it. And the cappucino was absolutely disgusting, even with the vanilla shot.  I felt like it was all vanilla and no coffee - yuck.  Also, when I give cashiers a coupon or a sticker card for free coffee, they always give me dirty looks.  Defo negative.  \n\nVerdict: uhh...if you're drunk, bored from waiting for your SO to finish shopping, have a coupon, then go ahead - otherwise not worth it it at all."}
{"text":"worst place ever we took our son for a Kids meal... took them for ever to get the order in place and on top of that they forgot to put the toy in a happy meal. \n\nthere was a line in the store but majority of staff was busy cleaning instead of taking care of people. \n\nthumbs down"}
{"text":"This place is noisy! All thanks to 3 raucous employees. They talked non-stop while serving the drive through customers. Were barely courteous to customers in between their noisy bits of gossip and loud singing and flailing arms ( that could be mistaken for a dance move)...\n\n2 stars for the other courteous staff, who took care of customer service."}
{"text":"4 stars mainly for the coffee! \nOtherwise this is the standard fare McDonalds location located in the middle of Heartland."}
{"text":"Yeah... I know what your thinking, 4 stars for a McDonald's? That's nuts!\n\nSo, the food is what you can expect. Full of salt, full of things that are not good for your health and full of mouth watering joy. I'll admit that.\n\nThe reason I gave this location 4 stars is simply  because I love what they are doing with their new concept stores. McDonald's is revamping their locations to feel warmer, cozier and more inviting. Also, the staff at this location were incredibly responsive to their customers' needs and wants.\n\nYou want more Mac sauce on the side? You got it. You did not like the toy you got with your kid's meal? Here's another one that might be better for you. And everything is done quickly and with a smile. How can you not love that.\n\nSo, if your at Heartland Town Center and feel like having a little Micky-D's, this is the perfect spot.\n\nNow pass me those fries."}
{"text":"Was so pissed. When I got home I discovered that my large french fries  were only half full. I could have paid for a medium and got the same amount. \n\nThe whole experience was bad. Long wait in the drive thru. They didn't even ask if I wanted  ketchup.  Tried to give me the wrong  drink. Then to discover  the French fries were half empty when I got home. The burgers were Luke warm.\n\nWorst McDonald's ever! Needless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant  ever again."}
{"text":"this mcdonalds was SUPER fancy looking on the inside and outside- it was pretty unusual to see. otherwise it was a pretty standard mcdonalds. kinda slow service here though."}
{"text":"I'm constantly disappointed in this mcdonalds and it's the closest one to me sadly . But today was just the last leg for me , I guess my order was too complicated no onion no pickle on a cheese burger w/ melted cheese ( because most times the cheese is not melted ) and my receipt had my order correct but my burger still came with onions and pickles . So I went inside and waited for a new one to be prepared . Only to watch the lady preparing my food give me sooo much attitude , and cover my burger in ketchup . \nI just left the burger there , customer service was piss poor today . And every other day . Everyone looked miserable ."}
{"text":"There is a new manager here, best McDonald's in town since Joyce has been there. Place is clean, service is fast and always correct. People are friendly there."}
{"text":"Just went in to get fries and a drink. It was hot and I hadn't eaten all day. I was waiting on the bus that takes forever to come and decided to go in and grab some food. Was standing at the counter for what seemed like forever, no one was at the register. Too many customers not enough employees. I left and just ate at home."}
{"text":"I took my son thru the drive thru last night and it was just horrible. He got a hot fudge sundae w/extra hot fudge in which we paid 35 cents extra for the extra fudge. They didn't put the extra on that we ordered. We ordered it on top and on the bottom. He also ordered hash browns and a milk. Apparently they burned the first order so we waited over 10 minutes at the window. Cars were piling up in line and the manager was annoyed that I asked for the extra hot fudge that I paid for. He took the ice cream to supposedly put the extra hot fudge on. We didn't realize till we were home that instead of hot fudge he put chocolate syrup on that they put in the coffees. It was a lot thinner than the original dab of hot fudge and smelled like Hershey syrup or any cheap chocolate syrup u would put in milk. Service is HORRIBLE. DONT GO HERE. The one in Indian Trail in much better. The one in Wesley Chapel is not good either. Employees bullied my boys and their friend because they didn't believe the age of my 15yr old. One employee threatened to beat up my youngest child when he stuck up for his brother. They really need to straighten up these McDonalds around here."}
{"text":"Truly the most horrible McDonald's on the planet and personally I wish they would just go out of business instead of wasting peoples time going there at all.. I blame the horrible owners the \"Harristons I've called them at 704-545-5970 and complained to them before the only way to really get something done is complain to corporate. You call the location directly on the phone its always busy, of course it is because they don't want every customer that comes there to be calling and complaining..."}
{"text":"I wish I could give less stars. I don't know how accurate that A rating is, how dirty can a place be and still get an A."}
{"text":"I always go there and it's always good food, no matter what, PS: The fries and the Ice Cream/ hot fudge sundaes are the best!!"}
{"text":"Consistently the slowest service ever experienced at any McD's."}
{"text":"I don't know how, but everytime I go to this McDonalds they always seem to find a way to screw up the order."}
{"text":"Went to McDonalds and my sister bought me a sausage biscuit sandwich and I would have thought I was eating a slider sandwich. What in the hell is McDonalds think they are getting away with...\nShame on McDonalds..."}
{"text":"Do these people take classes in being rude? They are very good at it. Mostly because they know the American consumer is going to buy their crappy good regardless of the terrible service."}
{"text":"Super fast service! love this McDonald's! You're in and out of the drive thru in no time! EVEN WHEN ITS FULL! The inside is really modern/ nice and clean! Staffs pretty friendly! Yay!"}
{"text":"This is the newest McDonald's in North Las Vegas, and possibly the Vegas Valley. In similar fashion to newly opened businesses, this one starts out on a clean slate.\n\n   The atmosphere is upbeat because everything is brand new and clean. With the newness, there is some neat features. The one that stands out is a screen similar to the DMV that flashes your order number when it is ready. In similar fashion to new and remodeled McDonald's, there is a McCafe and indoor playground..\n\n  The employees appear cheerful. The service was fast and friendly.\n\n  I am a fan of new businesses. Especially new McDonald's that are upbeat restaurants. I bestow the newest North Las Vegas McDonald's with 4-stars."}
{"text":"The first few months it was open I would have reviewed this place a five but now they are hiring the biggest retards (Michelle). My wife recently came thru the drivethru to order ice cream and was treated with the upmost disrespect. The attitudes, eye rolling and smirks makes this unprofessional team just a place I will not spend a dine on. From nice folks to GHETTO attitudes was something I hoping this site would not hire but they did. Absolutely stay away from this place and I hope this McDonald's just close outright."}
{"text":"Best McDonald's  I have ever visited! Clean and employees  are awesome!  Visit  here frequently  and always get great service."}
{"text":"I hate it when they take your order and ask \"Is that all?\" after every single item. It's very rude and should be addressed by management.\n\nThis was done by the person working the first window in 6/12/16 at 6:56pm."}
{"text":"McDonald's scares me now, to much trying to be like the other guys. \nDo McDonald's even host birthday parties anymore like back in the 80's and 90's? Lol \"MAC n Me\" xD it's a movie, trust me, kids now days have NO clue what I'm talking about.\n\nNuggets...what are they?\nAnd what ever happen to the McFriends????"}
{"text":"This location is right near my place I go here for an occasional coffee or early breakfast/lunch. They've really upped the game on food over the years. Still lovin the egg mc muffin! Great service here and they aren't always saying \"sorry, we are out of this or that, etc\"."}
{"text":"Very friendly service.  I went today and they gave me a sand timer. They had let me know if the sand runs out before I get my meal I would get a free sandwich.  Ok sounds like fun.  They had my food ready before the sand ran out.  I thought this was a great idea! Until I got home.  Just because the food is fast doesn't mean that it will come out looking nice.  My big Mac was super sloppy.  My daughters meal was missing her apple slices and her dipping sauce even though they verified with me that it was there.  My fries were crazy cold. But the service was super great. I wish they would pay more attention to working on quality of food not the speed of delivery."}
{"text":"I have been to the location so many times I stopped counting. The customer service has been great till tonight.  When you call for a manager and she clearly is having a bad day or hates her job. I just had a simple request and she had the nerve to twist her neck at me like I asked her to do more then to help me with the issue that her employee made an error on. I just asked her if she could ring my order again so I can use my coupon she said NO. I am like wow. I just don't want my order then. I understand that computers have issues but there is a way to talk to people. Just remember to treat others as you want to be treated. I got the store managers name an number. I still will visit that location not going to let one bad experience stop me from going there again. But that manager hopefully have a better day or like her job that day."}
{"text":"usually clean. workers are very professional and friendly. but the managers are rude and unhelpful. they usually talk to me like i owe them something for inconveniencing them by eating here. but the actual servers and cashiers are wonderful and very polite. i feel bad for them. : /"}
{"text":"Me and the wife refer to this McDonald's as the \"Nazi McDonald's\". They're very strict here and they never run the specials that other McDonald's do. They never seen to have the most brightest people at the front counter taking orders."}
{"text":"This McDonald's gets bonus points for its newness factor.  There's also a playground for the kiddos. It seems like it's busy most of the time, but the employees sure try their best to crank out orders as fast as possible.  Another plus- the employees actually smile and are friendly!  The restaurant area is clean and thus far all my orders have been correct.  This is probably my favorite McDonald's location."}
{"text":"I prefer this Mickey D's Location better than the Craig Location. I Usually Get Very Good Customer Service here, Whether it be a Manager, or Counter Worker. Always Greeted with a Smile, and I My Iced Coffee I get here is On Point! Every Time..lol!\n\nThe Interior is Kept Clean, and there is a Play area for the Little Ones to Enjoy as well. \n\nThe Only Think that you Should Take Note on, is that During the Hours of 1:30pm- 3:30pm it WIll Get Busy, Noisy, and You Will Have to Wait a While Before Ordering, or Getting Your Order! Why? You Say? Well, During those times are when the Teenagers from the Nearby High School are Off from School, and that's why there are Those Signs that Other Yelpers have Posted are on the Door! \n\nHappy Yelping!"}
{"text":"Fancy inside:  lounge area with a tv; kids area with play gound, and tables; and another separated area with a t.v."}
{"text":"People have come not to expect much from McDonald's which is both sad and true, half the time you get real good service and the other half your very bad service.  On the same coin, at times the food is great and fresh, others it's lack luster and generally bad.  I could write this for almost any mcdonalds but at this certain location I do have to say I get better service than most."}
{"text":"I guess no stars isn't an option? Terrible location. Line is taking way too long, normally a very patient person but this is ridiculous and its raising my Lyft total by the second. Just wanted some hash browns and water. Smh."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I ordered the mozzarella sticks and it was unconvincing.  There was no cheese inside the sticks. The order didn't come with the sauce either so I had to eat them dry as it is. I realized that McDonald's doesn't have anything on their menu for me except their fries, coffee and snack wraps. There is a reason why i haven't had a mcd burger in over 4 years."}
{"text":"I use to like this McDonald's but they started to close their 2nd drive thru at around 12 which makes the line extra long (20-30min) wait time. They don't except cards at certain time due to rebooting the system; with no sign."}
{"text":"Pretty basic McDonalds.  It was packed on a Saturday at lunchtime with all sorts of people from families to construction workers.\n\nService at the counter was friendly and they got to me quickly.  The dining room is one of the \"upgraded\" kinds and was nicer and bright.  When I went to sit down all of the booth tops were pretty much filthy so I had to clean off mine which sucked.  The floor needed sweeping.  They did have one staff member working the dining room, but he was checking trash cans and refilling ketchup.  He finally got to cleaning tables by the time we were done.  With this much traffic they should have had 2 people out front.\n\nAnyhoo....no comments about the food since it was all standard, no different from any other McDonalds."}
{"text":"I've been waiting in the drive thru for 29 minutes now... I could have had a real meal at a sit-down restaurant at this point. The staff didn't even pretend to look rushed."}
{"text":"Simply the worst.  Mcdonalds are all the same, but this one never gets it right.  Not mater how small or large the order is.  Sat this morning in line for 10 minutes.   I would have left but was in a spot where i could not move, and hag to stay put.   They are the slowest ever."}
{"text":"I come to this McDonald's alot, because it is convenient for my commute to work,  it always makes me late.  I swore I wouldn't come back, but like an idiot I though t I would try again.  I waited in line behind five (5) other people for 15 minutes before we all decided to just leave as one of the 4 employees filled the coffee bean machine and one guy tried to handle the cooking.  I will never come back again. also part of the proper was customers coming back in that got screwed at the drive thru.  people do not have time in the morning for this nonsense."}
{"text":"My small coffee I order almost every morning is always ordered the same way...4 creams, 3 sugars.  Every morning it tastes different.  \n\nSlowest McDonalds and worst customer service!"}
{"text":"This glorious food is so bad for me, but they really make up for their unhealthy food with excellent service! Maybe our cashier was having a wonderful day or maybe she was just born sweet...but she really hooked us with with some mega M food!\n\nWe got to use 3 coupons simultaneously and received 2 fish filets, 2 chicken wraps, a large fry, and a large drink for $4. It really cannot get better than this!\n\nThis McDonalds was clean and fresh!  Thank you for redeeming the arches for us!"}
{"text":"This franchise is one I tend to avoid. Skimpy on the fries, order comes wrong...just have to constantly double check order correctness. Last time I went in, they simply did not my order in the system at all. It wasn't until I asked someone that we were able to get the order complete."}
{"text":"They got the order all wrong instead of a large coke i got someone's unsweetened tea that tasted like Cigarettes. Thats disgusting and ridiculous, get your shit together people. What time does this location even close! they need to put hours on the map."}
{"text":"WORST drive thru service in the area.  rude nasty counter people also.  will never go there again after this morning."}
{"text":"This location has let me down each time I've been there in the 1.5 years I've lived in the area. There has never been one visit where my order was correct. Sometimes it is little things like missing sauces, but most of the time (like today) I'm missing sandwiches or fries. Today we were shorted a McDouble and I received the wrong burger as a part of a value meal. Best of luck - maybe I'm just unlucky."}
{"text":"This site will mess up your drive thru order regularly.   It's close to us and the kids want to go but I now have to pull every order out of the bag to check I.  Too many teens working the window with more attention on their phones and Facebook than the orders."}
{"text":"Slowest McDs. I waited in the drive thru for my food for 10 minutes at the last window and was treated to a show: a woman - fresh from Orange is the New Black - was delivering an epic soliloquy to an audience of her co-workers who all had terrified looks on their faces. After someone reminded her that I and the other cars were waiting for our orders she opened her window shoved the food at me and said, \"HERE!\" Like she had been waiting on ME the whole time. Won't be back.  TOO WEIRD!!!!"}
{"text":"There were no customers after my order. Waited 15 minutes for a McDouble.  Not really fast food there.  Drink station was a mess like it hadn't been checked.  A spilled drink on the floor waiting for a lawsuit.  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This McDonald's always disappoints me! I always get  fries and they are always stail! I told them to make it fresh and when i got them they were still cold and definitely did not taste fresh!"}
{"text":"Our order took 20 minutes. The manager said it was because of them switching from breakfast lo lunch and she didn't look like she cared anyway. My wife's breakfast wrap was cold and barely any egg. I would avoid this location as the food and service is poor."}
{"text":"Wake me up when they start offering all day breakfast..  Considering it's the only edible thing McDonald's even makes.\n\nAlso the drive through here is slow as molasses."}
{"text":"This is one of the larger McDonald's in the area with a pretty huge play area for the kids. The food is the usual you'd expect from the chain and the drive-thru is sufficiently speedy."}
{"text":"bad service, cold fries and my meal got served to someone else.\n\nthe line up to buy food was insane, and the service was beyond disappointing.\n\npeople were actually recording the rude interactions that the staff were projecting and when someone asked for the manager she dismissed them."}
{"text":"I have to redeem these guys (based on their other reviews.....take it easy people) -- they're not that bad.  And if your fries are cold, go up and get new ones - LOL.\n\nI went in for lunch.  It's the high school / family crowd.  Screaming children included.  Not very many business people, but that's fine. \n\nHad a good / quick lunch there.  Service was fast.  Food was hot.  \n\nI'll be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Degeulasse . Service tr√®s lent pour un McDonald . Pratique pour une frite a trois heure du matin sinon a eviter. J'ai eu la chiasse de ma vie par la suite ...."}
{"text":"Very dirty the staff is in polite there are homeless people sleeping there in the morning when I used to go get a coffee plus the food is not fresh even for mcdonalds standard"}
{"text":"Oh well, McDonald reste McDonald. Une frite ou un McFlurry de temps en temps lors d'une soir√©e arros√©e ou un caf√© s'il est gratuit (reste qu'il est meilleur que celui du Tim!), mais le reste du menu je pr√©f√®re √©viter. Le service de cette succursale est particuli√®rement lent pour aucune raison apparente, mais c'est le plus proche de chez moi alors c'est le plus pratique lors des urgences frites √† 2AM.."}
{"text":"Service froid. Bouffe froide (trio McCrepes). Client√®le toujours aussi d√©primante. √Ä √©viter."}
{"text":"Very pretty McDonalds. Lets be honest, I don't normally go to a McDonalds for their food or elegance. I usually come here on a rare occasion.\n\nThe plus side, 90% of the time clean & the food is good. The fry oil is changed frequently. I have noticed a couple times I came in it had flies... I won't eat inside because they keep it so cold in here (during summer)..  I rather sit outside on the patio, & enjoy my food HOT.\n\nI've had great service here before but  service seems to have gotten worse. The other thing is the location is expected to always be BUSY.   I hate coming here when it's lunch hour."}
{"text":"Thinking too myself why the hell would I ever write review about golden arches because seen one seen them all. SO NOT true about this location. The food need not say anything because its  McDonald classic been around forever still have the best french fries. \n\nThe main reason for this review is all about the atmosphere and for SURE the interior design. We all think fast food go plastic chairs, maybe run down, no tv, and nothing special or gets ones attention. Not the case with this one! The exterior design who the hell sees water fountain in front of McD. Once get inside they have all these separate areas almost stand out by themselves. Walk in left have wide screen tv area chill out, the one area they have chandelier hanging and nice big widescreen watch with lounge chairs/basically going too starbucks or coffee shop area, even the kids play area nothing like normal ones with the plastic balls or the kids climbing around (it couple turtles kids play around and even mini play house) and walk around lot cleaner kids area then normal ones, and even the soda fountain area two separate ones lots of choices all really clean, and just everything about the place is different. I been too many McD in my lifetime so far and swear never in life imagine McD this nice or really feels more like restaurant then fast food joint. If ever want enjoy the finer McD in life check this one out. Lol!!!"}
{"text":"It's amazing how they are ALWAYS \"only accepting cash\" in the middle of the night...\n\nThey also make it very clear that they are annoyed if you tell them you have cash because that means they actually have to work.\n\nThese employees are horrible when it comes to customer service and getting orders right. I understand a few very minor mistakes but they always screw something up- it never fails. I've stayed away from this location for months and I made the mistake of stopping by tonight. \n\nDrive the extra few miles to the one on Warm Springs & Las Vegas BLVD. they always have their sh_t straight!"}
{"text":"It's McDonald's.  If you don't know what this place is all about...well...\n\nAnyway, one of the cleaner playplaces in town.  The kids enjoy coming here on weekends and mingling with the other kids.  Us parents, well...we sit around and munch on fries and nuggets.\n\nStill the best place for perfectly mixed fountain Coke though.  No place does Coke like Micky Ds."}
{"text":"Well, needed to get a quick bite and some coffee for the drive to CA\n\nthis location is pretty convenient, right near the 215, so easy to drive thru and get an order for the road!\n\nI know it's only McDonalds's, but hey, quick and cheap is good sometimes\n\nplus, I had to make sure to get my annual McRib\nglad they only sell once in awhile because that way you won't get sick of this sweet, gooey bbq reformed pork \"riblet\".  I still say yum\n\ngot a McRib EVM, bought the extra McRib for a buck and got large coffee\nthere was a bit of a line in the drive thru lanes, but still ordered and done in 10 mins, then onto the freeway to CA!"}
{"text":"Not a typical McDonald's, really clean, unusually friendly staff and I got my food in under 45 seconds. Nice place."}
{"text":"The only McD's I will eat at. Not only is the decor bright and fun and totally unlike any other McD's I've ever seen, but the food is always 100% picture perfect. Everything is always hot, fresh and literally looks like the food they show in the commercials. My burger never appears stepped on or flattened or half wrapped like the other fast food places. I see many other people have already commented on the unique interior and it is very charming and way cooler than any fast food place. I give this location an A+ in every catergory!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick breakfast.  Plenty of parking.  Large facility.  This is the nicest McDonald's we've ever been to.  Sort of fancy.  Service was great.  Place was spacious and clean and plenty of areas to sit and for kids to play.  Food was good and hot.  If we're in the area, we'll come by again if we want McDonald's."}
{"text":"Didn't think I'd be reviewing a McDonald's like most people have been saying on here, but I'm finally annoyed enough to write. First off, I walk in and there's a guy texting on his phone behind the front counter and behind the shift lead. If this Corporate location is attempting to make McDonald's look more upscale and professional, then the employees should be the part as well. Texting in front of customers is unacceptable, whether on break or not. If you're on break, you should be using your cell phone in a non-public area, out of view of guests. Second, the shift lead that took my order rang up the wrong special order on my Crispy Chicken Classic because she was distracted by engaging in conversation with co-workers... which should stop completely when a guest is present. I think this location lacks accountability of its employees, and soon, it will become a free-for-all if a stop isn't put to it."}
{"text":"My gf and I stopped by this location after a night of partying to satisfy our late night munchies. It was a mistake, McDs is not In n Out. The fries were soggy and the burgers were bit cold. The drive through service was very fast, could be because it was around 12AM."}
{"text":"never again !! Sat. morning took my daughter to breakfast there. she had 2 breakfast burritos &.a hash brown. We sat down inside\nthe second burrito had a bug on it the kind with the pincher at the end so I took it to the cashier asked for the manager I show it to him with a confused look. he then showed it to i'm assuming she was the owner plain clothes behind the counter Asian lady. listen to this excuse it blew my mind she said that it must have flown on the burrito I told her there is no wings,then she says it can't be from us because everything is brought in frozen and if it was from them the bug would be dead! Really!"}
{"text":"We are truly blessed to have one of the nicest mcdonalds in town, and only a few minutes away from my home. I don't eat here much anymore, but this mcdonalds is always first on my list whenever I need some food. \n\nThank the foodie gods for this beautiful and CLEAN McDonalds."}
{"text":"Horrible..... their latte machine is always broken in the morning and they dont tell you untill after you have waited in line and then pay. The lady asked me \"Would you like something else like a diet coke or something?\" Yeah like instead of a hot latte to start my day at 5am I'd prefer a diet coke :rolls eyes:. Today when I ordered breakfast (one sausage egg mcmuffin, a sausage biscuit and two hash browns) i noticed my bag was a little light so I looked and the mcmuffin wasn't inside. I let her know and they gave me the sausage mcmuffin. I opened it before leaving and there was no egg on it. I let her know and she said I needed to pay for it. I told her that's ridiculous that if i didnt even check i wouldn't have got anything let alone the egg. The manager got an attitude and said \"You know what forget you\" and gave me my mcmuffin with egg. I mean come on. Seriously. Fix your customer service AND your latte machine and stop wasting my time in the morning when I'm trying to get to work. I wish I could give ZERO stars."}
{"text":"Never thought in a million years I be writing a review on McDonald's but I thought this visit warranted one.  I have to preface this with the only reason I actually went inside to eat was I was with a friend who has a toddler and the only thing that was going to make him happy was the play land area. Ok here goes, when we first walked in I noticed all the fake plants everywhere, and the fountain, and the bench. Am I at McDonald's or an old ladies house? By far the strangest mcds I've ever been to. Then it gets more interesting, the inside is a poor attempt at making this a hip lounge. With damask wallpaper and a small sitting type lounge area with a cheap chandelier, I couldn't help but laugh. Oh and did I mention the guy passed out sleeping in this \"lounge\" area? Random men were walking in and out of the restrooms, I truly felt like I was in the twilight zone. \n\nNow onto the service, we had a fairly simple order, and not only did they get it wrong not once, but 3 times, and gave us an attitude with it. This isn't rocket science people. Learn to speak English.\n\nI know why I never go to fast food places now."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would.  I ordered a deluxe quarter pounder with no cheese I asked at the first window for her to doublecheck and make sure there was no cheese she said she did when I got to the second window to pick up the food I asked if there was cheese on my sandwich he looked at the bag he looked at the box and he said no but he didn't open the box when I got home not only was there cheese there was two pieces of cheese I'm very allergic.  their help needs to be more aware that there are people with food allergies"}
{"text":"For a McDonald's definitely not bad! The interior is very nice and definitely not your average McDonald's. The food is just about the same as any other McDonald's but it comes out a lot faster. The drive thru here is almost always lined up so I have to go inside to get food, but it's not a problem. Recently I decided to go to the drive thru because I was in a rush and the line went through really fast! The workers here are also very friendly and they make sure your order is right before you pay. This is also my go-to McDonald's since I live in the area, love this location!"}
{"text":"The moment I pull up and walk inside I'm thinking...Is this really Mcdonald's?!  It sure doesn't look like the typical Mcdonald's.  It's got a remarkable interior including a chandelier, lounge area,  a centerpiece on each table, clean play area, and flat screen tvs.  Exterior has a water fountain and plants.  Customer service is great."}
{"text":"As far a McDonalds go this is the one to visit.  The children's area is beautiful and the restaurant is always super clean.  What stands out though is the fries, they make the best fries of any McDonalds I have been to in the city."}
{"text":"This mcd is beautifully decorated for a McDonalds.  Warning: the flowers in vases are real and there is water in the vase as we learned by accident.  There's a play place and indoor/outdoor seating in case the weathers cooperating.  It's clean and the staff is friendly. NOTE: our visit was in the early evening on a friday and it's not too terribly busy except in the play place area. Also the play place is intended for smaller children. No big slide and climbing area."}
{"text":"This is THE McDonald's that everyone wishes were in their neighborhood.  Probably the newest one in Las Vegas, it definitely sets the bar of what you hope all McDonald's could be like!\n\nLocated on S. Rainbow with its major cross streets being Warm Springs and the 215, it has generated quite a buzz!\n\nWith a flowing fountain to welcome you, the inside feels more like a coffee lounge.  Cool color tones welcomes you to take advantage of their free WiFi and the large TV has you hanging out longer than you normally would.  \n\nInstead of the typical outdoor play area for kids with those plastic balls (an area rarely ever cleaned), this location has an indoor area that looks like it could be cleaned and inspected on a regular basis.  There's also a few larger tables set aside for what could be private parties - birthday parties at Mickey D's are coming back perhaps?\n\nNonetheless, this fast food joint and design are a welcome addition to the neighborhood, even if there's another McDonald's less than a mile away in the Arroyo Crossing shopping center."}
{"text":"Its a real shame this is probably the nicest Mcdonalds in Vegas BUT the most rude female manager(s) Ive ever encountered. I dont know her name but shes hispanic with drawn on eyebrows and gave me such a dirty look and the tone in her voice like she didn't want to show my daughter what other Troll toys they had . The point is to collect them . She got the same one and we asked to exchange and she did it so rude rushing me and i had to ask her 5 times for bbq for her happy meal . Just rude ass service ."}
{"text":"What a horrible place! If you are going to eat at McDonald's do not do it at this one! The service is awful and the assistant manager is even worse. I ordered approximately $10 in food and asked for 2 bbq sauces. She (the assistant manager) wanted .34 cents extra or she couldn't give them to me after I had bought $10 in food. She said she would rather refund my entire order than give me 2 bbq sauces for free. So guess what, she refunded my order! Horrible customer service - new management is needed! Never ever will return to this place!"}
{"text":"This Mc Donald's is clean and a newer one. I must admit iv never seen a McDonalds this nice before lol my kids enjoyed the little play area. Staff were fast and nice. Just wish there was a ketchup pump lol we had to use the packets . To much work when your hungry"}
{"text":"Quick drive through & walk in service!  Play area is indoors and next to the bathrooms.  It's so purple in here, not the usual red and yellow color theme.  Nice change!"}
{"text":"This resturant, even though its mcdonalds is an average one.they dont make any new meals, and when they do its months apart and is a lame new burger or drink."}
{"text":"If I could give this location ZERO stars I would.  For the FOURTH time since I've started  patronizing this location, I have ordered a Double Cheeseburger with NO onions, only to get it and bite into it and it is loaded with onions.  I have e-mailed the proprietor of the establishment the second time it happened and she assured me that she would have a discussion with the management and staff.  Either she did not or it did not sink in.  Not only that, but even when your order is right, the cheese is never melted on the burgers.  There is ketchup all over the side of the bun.  I used to work in a restaurant, so it is very rare that I am coarse or rude with the staff, because I know how customers can be rude and don't care and how most of these people are underpaid and are disrespected.  However, tonight I lost it after the fourth time with my order getting screwed up.  I demanded to see the manager and demanded my money back.  She proceeded to give me a refund for the double cheeseburger only.  I had to explain to her that I got the extra value meal and showed her my receipt.  She started to argue with me that the meal was half eaten, which was a lie.  I may have had six fries out of a medium fry, one bite of the burger, which I spit out when I got a mouth full of onions and I had a quarter of the coke, mostly to get the disgusting onion taste out of my mouth.  She finally gave me the refund.  I should know better than to even go to McDonald's, but it's always good when you're in a hurry.  However, I am 100% DONE with this location."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service in the world i recieved my food thru the drive thru and it was wrong i then had to wait 5 minutes before i had to start honking for some attention and they tookk 10 more mins to get me the right stuff it was at like 9 at night. hate this place."}
{"text":"I hate McDonald's but I have an 11 year old. So I tell her she can pick the food McDonald's. So the one but my house rainbow and badura SUCK THEY ALWAYS FORET SOMETHING. THE ALWAYS LEAVE OUT SOMETHING. GET IT TOGETHER YOUR JOB DOES NOT REQUIRE A MASTERS IN BRAIN SCIENCE.  lord they want to always charge people extra money for things get they don't want to ever put those things inside the bag and give them to the persons who paid for said things.  Get your crap together at that location. It's never a good experience"}
{"text":"This McDonald has no sense of customer service. Besides the fact that they make people wait to then forget about them it's ridiculous! I guess the so call \"managers\" (ladies with purple shirts) do not set a good example for their employees! I used to like this McDonalds, they had great employees that cared about the customer, now, with the bad example the managers (or whoever the ladies with Purple shirts are) are setting, has a domino effect on the regular employees! \nAnd for what I noticed their attitude expresses \"what does this person expect, it's McDonald's\"! \nShame!!! What a shame!"}
{"text":"Just went to the drive thru thinking i was going to enjoy some chicken mc nuggets but noooooooo these things were soooooooo old and i could tell they've been reheated at least twice. I work in the food industry and fast food or not, you should always think about the quality your giving your customers. Never eating there again."}
{"text":"Great service, clean and great interiors! It even has a chandelier inside! What more can you say about a fast food joint. You really don't feel like you're eating at a fast food joint inside here."}
{"text":"Not really sure how one can go from wanting Thai food to ending up in a McDonald's drive-thru.  But after sitting through a Wranglers game, everyone was famished and the Thai place was closed, and necessity was the order of the evening.  This particular drive-thru was quick and friendly and the food was as McDonald's does....A-OK."}
{"text":"This is the nicest McDonald's I've been to.  Clean, new modern decor, flowers on the table.  Nice looking patio outside too.  Very nice play area for the kids.  If I didn't know better, I would have thought I was actually in a good restaurant.   As usual, the food the same as any other McDonald's.   They get a 4 for actually being a nice place to sit down.  Well done McDonald's!  Exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"Okay we'll it's McDonald's food but...during lunch they have a person standing outside to take orders. Line was long but I got through in three min. Freaking awesome."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!! Went thru drive a little before 4pm and ordered a small coffee and a burger....the employee handed me the coffee with the lid not fully on and basically spilled it all over me....There was an assistant mgr behind her who had \"Myles\" tattooed on her arm and basically giggled behind the employee and then disappeared...the coffee was all over my lap and on my console and all over my seat and spilled all over my right hand...there was a few people behind me so I just took the napkins and parked to clean up....I called a few minutes later and asked to speak to a manager and some woman answered and said she was the manager....I told her about what had just occurred and that nobody seemed to care and she says \"what do u want me to do pal? Drive u to the ER?\"....so I asked her name and she said something inaudible and so I asked the name of the store manager and she then proceeded to hang up.....I called later and got the name of that VERY UNPROFESSIONAL ASSISTANT manager COURTNEY and the name of the store manager ELIZABETH RODRIGUEZ and have left a message for her to call me back but as of yet, I have heard nothing.....if you ever have a problem at this location and some BELLIGERENT/TRASHY woman named COURTNEY IS SPEAKING TO YOU, probably best to call the corporate number right there.....worst experience at a McDonald's EVER!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This location has been renovated with current colors and decor.  Inside you will be surprised to find purple, black and grey as the theme, a small play area for kids and equally kind-to-parents sitting area where those kids can be watched over and still have a conversation.  I can see they are going for a cafe experience and they might have nailed it.  \n\nMost impressive is the staff at this particular location.  They are clean, polite and look like they are going somewhere in life, not like they could not make it.  \n\nThe food is still poison, and we still crave and submit to it because they have been pumping it into our brains and bodies for decades.  They created an addiction by processing and mutilating food.  But at least you can enjoy it in a new atmosphere.  I'm no stronger than the next person, but I limit my intake.  \n\nChow Chow~"}
{"text":"Just took my daughter in for a kids meal and a vanilla ice cream cone. It was very clean and they had a kids play place. It was decorated very nice and even had a waiting place with a TV."}
{"text":"The cleanest and comfortable atmosphere McDonald's by far.  Our orders are always to the \"T\" with friendly. Thank you for your great customer service keep up the good work"}
{"text":"This McDonalds location can be found right next door to Egg Works on Rainbow Blvd. and Badura Avenue.\n\nI am not a huge Mickey D's fan. That being said, when you are heading to work between 4 and 5 am there are limited options for something quick to eat on the go. \n\nBecause of all this, most of my experiences here has been with the drive thru. However, the other day the drive thru line was literally lined up into Badura Avenue, so I parked and walked inside to get my egg mcmuffin fix. I have to say that the interior of this McDonalds is definitely much nicer than your typical location. It was very clean and had a more stylish design, at least by McDonalds standards.\n\nThe employees here have always been nice enough and the service is typically performed in a timely manner. \n\nIt serves a very specific purpose for me and I will keep coming back. \n\nI like this place. It is A-OK.\n\n3 stars."}
{"text":"My brother and I came here at 2:20 am for a French Vanilla Late and they did not have any. Apparently, they where cleaning the machine! My brother order an Ice Coffee and of course they did not have any. We asked for coffee and they where out of it as well. We decided to leave and they had the nerve of asking if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"I can only review the drive thru as I have never been inside this particular location. In my experience, this location can be hit or miss. It's near my home, so I have been coming here for the last seven years at least once a month, if not more. Don't judge me. I won't stop here for breakfast anymore. I only like the Egg McMuffin, but when I did order breakfast, the muffin was always burnt. Sometimes to the point that it was completely inedible. The first time it happened, the smell of burnt toast lingered in my car for a week. I of course immediately took it back and they exchanged it for something else. After a few more visits with similar experiences during breakfast, I just drive by now and go to Jack n the Box up the street. On the plus side, the regular menu is always hot and fresh. The staff here is not the friendliest, but my orders have always been correct, and I don't really go to a drive thru for the service."}
{"text":"What can I say ? I try to avoid eating here, but I am a sucker for their Caramel mocha coffee and an occasional breakfast item. I suggest you try the mocha !"}
{"text":"As the food is as expected from any McDonald's, I only have a concern for how long it takes in the drive thru in the morning, and how sloppy the lobby looks inside. I usually only come because my kids can play, but the full trash cans rude employees that hardly smile are getting to me.\nThe morning crew are very friendly and happy. They were also very patient but the line in drive thru came to a halt too many times for as small as the drive thru is. \nThe afternoon people seem to forget that there are customers in the lobby. The tables and drink area seem to go unnoticed, but the one person who does clean the lobby pulls one trash can then clocks out because you can see her waiting for her ride in the lobby. \nMcDonald's is known for its food but customers want to come back for the service. I would recommend this place for the morning, as you can get hot food and smiling faces, and not for the afternoon. Be careful when you bring your kids because one manager already embarrassed my child in the play land because she took a lot of wipes. You could automatically tell she doesn't have kids by the way she spoke to my child."}
{"text":"i usually stop by this mcdonalds on the way to work. the food is ok after all it is mcdonalds. the reason im reviewing this place and the reason I keep on going back is the girl there, I think she is a manager. she wears her hair up and has the cutest rectangular glasses. shes an average looking girl, but there is just something about her, the way she moves and carries herself. she is soo dam sexy I just want to have my way with her!"}
{"text":"This McDs is brilliant!! Great local and great staff!!! This is the store I go to whenever I'm in this area. \n\nThe staff here is really fast and friendly, the GM and owner is often in store so any issues that come up are handled quickly and professionally."}
{"text":"One of the better McDonald's locations in the southwest area that's for sure. I came here last night with my mom and nephew. I'm not huge on fast food but when the family request to stop hey what can I do? Fall into temptation and order something light.. Drive-thru is always my first choice because I am lazy and hate going inside, only way that happens is if I had something wrong with my order. Tonight that wasn't the case thank GOD! Young girl who was taking orders was very pleasant and had great customer service skills I'm sure Ronald McDonald would be proud lol. Our order was requested to be made fresh as I know that in fast food if you don't request it fresh there is a highly possible chance you will get something that's been sitting in that tray for who knows how long. Learned my lesson too many times so FRESH is the way to go!. In this case we were asked to park as they were still preparing. Order came out within about 7 minutes everything was correct! No complaints!"}
{"text":"This use to be the best Mcdonalds in the area.. however, not anymore.\n\nIn the last year ive noticed food takes so long to make, noone is polite or friendly here, frappes are blended to liquid consistency or have large ice chunks in it.  Everyone seems bored to death in there. Sometimes takes over 10 mins or more just to order the food and then get to the window to pay. No phone calls back despite phoning them more than once. Most employees need the manager or supervisor to make a drink for them. its a mess.\n\nAlso saw rats run by multiple times outside.. not sure if its an issue inside but I haven't gone here in couple months due to the terrible service! lost me as a customer and now go to another mcdonald's."}
{"text":"Been going here for 7 years. Horrible, slow service. 20 mins waiting in the drive thru with only 5 cars in front of you. They cannot refer to this as fast food. They also screw up your order 3 out of 4 times, so make sure you thoroughly check your bag. They told me our sauces were in the bag, nope they weren't. Got home and we are missing French fries in a happy meal. If we had other options near here we would would never come back."}
{"text":"I can understand why this McDonald's has only a two star rating. I ordered through the drive-through, got all the way to Carefree highway and Cave Creek road only to discover they did not prepare my meal correctly. Drove all the way back and then was treated with the most rude behavior as though I was an inconvenience for them in order to get my meal correct.I asked for the owners phone number and name and was denied that, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard why you can't get a hold of the owner of the business to let them know how poorly their businesses is ran great indication of a terrible business owner. I would never ever come nor can I recommend this McDonald's. The worst McDonald's I've ever eaten at in my life. On top of all that at the end of the day when I got my new cheeseburger it was dry, tasteless, thrown together and absolutely terrible. tasting."}
{"text":"Decided to have a sausage egg McMuffin for dinner (because you can!) and went to this McDonalds with my spouse.  I took one bite, hard as a rock.  When I looked at it the egg yolk was a dark greenish gray color.  Really disgusting.  They made me a fresh one.  Very glad I didn't do the drive through and take home a bag of gray-green egg mcmuffin."}
{"text":"Ordered a sausage egg mcmuffin & they substitute a scrambled egg because they are out of the regular egg BUT they don't tell you. I go in to return it & they do the same thing to another customer. That's just wrong."}
{"text":"How are McDonald's employees going on strike for 15 dollars an hour when I come thru at 10:30 only person in line and order pickles and onions only but end up having to scrape sauce and lettuce off my Big Mac? Y'all are a disgrace I wouldn't pay y'all minimum wage if I was your boss. Never to return to this embarrassment of a McDonald"}
{"text":"Just to be fair. Contrary to othet posts, we take our kids there many times because we live nearby. Both dining in and drive through. Never any problems. The deco is great, upscale looking. Kids love the free archade games."}
{"text":"This is the slowest McDonald's!! 20 mins wait in the drive through, after taking the order."}
{"text":"Pretty nice as mcdonalds go. 4 is my standard review on a decent place. This one gets a 3 because of some drive-through mess ups. The biggest one was when I ordered a sausage and egg mcmuffin (and only that!) and instead got a bacon egg and cheese biscuit. Um...not the same thing, folks. Didn't realize until a few miles away when I got the chance to open it. Lame."}
{"text":"So I stopped in here 2nite to get a fish filet, 3 crispy chicken wraps and a quarter pounder w/extra pickles... The girl who took my order (wearing a bright blue shirt and big rimmed glasses) was kinda rude to begin with... After she told me my grand total (around 13 dollars) I gave her a twenty dollar bill and then she proceeded to get my change, so I held out my hand but instead of giving me my change  she proceeded to put my change on the counter and walk away... She NEVER told me that I had a number to listen for... But I go sit down on a cushy chair to wait for my order and about five mins later I hear her call out a number but I was unaware it was mine... About two mins go by and I here her scream the number yet again (but this time with more anger in her voice) so I stand up and when she sees me, she slams my food bag into the counter top and walks away all the while there were two ladies standing at the counter when she did this!!! I was like in shock n awe!!! I have no clue what I did to deserve this kind of treatment, as I visit this location several times a week placing the same order almost every time!!! I would like to know what her problem was with me so I know not to do it again? But all I can think of is that I was very pleasant towards her which did not warrant her behavior... I tried calling the store immediately upon getting into my car and it just rang and rang then an automated system picked up saying that the mailbox user has not set up their box yet, goodbye... Had I not been in a hurry to go check on my ailing father... I would have stayed and tracked down a manager, but unfortunately that was not the case. I've been trying to call this location for almost three hours now and still no one answers... I highly doubt that anyone from this store will read this post, but on an off chance that they do, I would like to speak with them immediately because if any of my employees ever treated a client like this, they would be out of a job!!! And I definitely would want to know if any of my staff were acting like this!!! I understand that everyone has a bad day from time to time, myself included... But you chose to work in the HOSPITALITY industry and no matter how terrible your day is... Your job is to make the guest experience a pleasurable one!!! Lastly, I had asked for extra pickles on my quarter pounder... I got ONE pickle instead and my fish filet looked like it had been sitting there for hours as the cheese was rock hard!!! My crispy chicken snack wraps were \"crispy\" all right!!! So crispy that the chicken was friend up and more like leather... While $13 dollars isn't gonna break the bank here... I don't think a business who didn't earn it should be rewarded with it for providing terrible service and inedible food... I've never met this employee before nor have I ever had a run in with her, so I don't understand why the attitude and poor service??? Can someone plz get back to me and explain this??? Thank you in advance! \n\nRegards,\n\nDaniel"}
{"text":"I don't usually both rating a fast food place.  But this was the nicest McDonald's I've seen in the US.  Nicest ever was McCaf√© in Brisbane where the waiter brings fresh chocolate croissants and espressos on fine china to your table.  So this isn''t the nicest ever but is still heads & shoulders above the others in town.\n\nThis location makes our local Starbucks look dumpy in comparison.  Check my photos.  Modern design throughout with a caf√© lounging area, touch screen video game corner for the tykes, pub tables, high-backed booths for privacy, blown glass sculptures and a chandelier.   Didn't use the restroom but would hazard a guess it is probably gorgeous as well.\n\nDouble lane drive-through jammed up at evening rush hour makes for a busy bee kitchen.  Folks were hustling hard.  Gotthe kids meals quickly.   And the wraps were a bit better stuffed than some of the other locations that really gyp you if you order them with grilled chicken.  My only regret was forgetting to order a coffee while I was there."}
{"text":"I ordered the southern fried chicken sandwich from drive-thru, it came without ANY condiments on it.  Just a plain piece of chicken on a bun?  Come on guys, get it right"}
{"text":"drivethru is horrible. even at off times you end up waiting much longer than typical McDonald's locations."}
{"text":"Seriously never going to this mcdonalds again. I'm no joke writing this from the drive through line. Got in line at 4:10. It's now 4:33 and I just received my food.  No apology. No hello. Just bad service"}
{"text":"I started driving by this McDonald's every week after the new tractor Supply Store opened and I couldn't resist the urge to stop for some hot fries. I also order a burger but, the fries are the main attraction for me.\nTime after time, I got cold fries. I always check them as soon as I get the tray. The workers usually seemed okay getting me some hot ones as I don't mind waiting but, the last time I went, I got the cranky attitude and a long wait. I did see a late worker come in apologizing so, maybe they were pissed at her and not me.....\nAfter five or six cold fry experiences, I filled out a mcdonalds survey and decided to try again in a month or three.\nHot fries rule. Cold fries remind me that I shouldn't be eating this kind of food."}
{"text":"Worst mcdonalds ever.\n\nYou always get hounded by the homeless and management never seems to do anything about it.\nSomething is always wrong in your order.\nI've had to have them remake orders 3 or 4 times.\nI've had them over charge.  Lie to me. Swear at me in Spanish assuming I don't understand.\nThe restaurant is always filthy and no one seems to have a clue \n\nAvoid this mcdonalds. If you must have your burger fix head to the mcdonalds at 24th street and osborn. It's clean, no homeless problem and they actually give you what you order."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times because of proximity to my house. However, I will no longer be giving this place my business. The last few times before this visit my order was given to me incorrectly.  Today, when I orderes a large combo I was told by the manager that they don't give large drinks with combos. She said this to me while standing under a sign that clearly read \"With Any drink for an additional charge.\" I am quite agitated by this place and there is a perfectly good Carl's Junior just down the street."}

Not only that my fries were super cold and that place is full of crackhead's and hookers and they just allowed them to hang out. ... won't be going back..."}
{"text":"This is literally thee slowest McDonald's I've ever been to. I understand it gets busy but I shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes stuck in the drive thru. They also have terrible customer service and the homeless problem is unnerving at times."}
{"text":"The nastiest McDonald's I have ever encountered. The management gave me an issue over using the restroom. I promised to buy food since that was why I was there. It was dirty and the stall that was ok was so because there was no t.p.\nI ordered a big Mac meal, I wanted to fill my own cup with tea. But they insisted a medium meal was a medium drink and besides you could NOT fill your own the foundation was off and no tea was out.\n\nThis location sucks and they know it. The complaint phone # and email are posted on the door.\n\nPlease don't go to this location."}
{"text":"Teenagers Stepping up to Fish Combo... oh the days if the simple Cheese Burger and nuggets...\\\n\nNice work Kiddo"}
{"text":"How often is it you see a chain fall so far from the standards for such a long period of time and yet corporate seems to just let them limp along.  It's a new , ok relatively new building but it doesn't look it. \n\nTonight is the second night we've been in a two month period were  no fountain drinks no cafes or drinks other than bottled water, apple juice or milk were around. It's not like we frequent the place but  when someone puts out a habanero burger I feel obligated to support em. \n\n Sadly the burger was the least juicy, scant of dressing one I've encountered so while it hints at getting hot there's not enough  on it to find out. \n\nThey appear, no let's be bold here and state it , they reheat / refry  their \"premium\" crispy chicken wrap   it's nasty even before you get to tonight's surprise which is rancid ranch... Yeah a bite and a run to the trash can to hurl it out..\n\nAs usual  no receipt, no real F's given about the lack of drinks, slow service  in fact  the opposite of the one up at T Bird / I17   If you have to eat  fast  and can go the extra couple of miles it probably will save you time and  result in edible food"}
{"text":"I took my son there to play and the play place was filthy....it was so loud I couldn't even hear myself think..my son is two and had to fight through all the big kids to even play with anything! Overall..just won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, drive thru worker was a thief! I was supposed to get $13 back in change and I only received $3. They said their drawer wasn't over so they wouldn't give me my money. This is by far the worst experience at this location but unfortunately not the only bad experience, they have messed up my order so many times I've lost count and the drive thru lines are always slow. The inside is never clean it smells horrid. The only good thing about this place is that it happens to be close to my house, I regret going there every time."}
{"text":"Could use a lot of help. Customer service isn't the greatest. Place could look better. Drive thru takes a while. Playground could use a good cleaning."}
{"text":"If I could this place no stars I would.  Slowest drive thru ever. Literally took 20 minutes to order. Then I was told to pull up and wait some more after I paid. They actually have designated spots for you to wait in which tells me they know how slow they are! This is not what I call fast food. NEVER AGAIN.  Next time I will just drive down the street to BK or Wendy's."}
{"text":"awful, people hand out here all hours of the night, panhandling and everyone smokes outside of front doors and side doors.\nno one does anything, i reported this over and over, now it is being reported to the state.  also, no one gets the orders right\nand hardly anyone is at the counters, and no one speaks english."}
{"text":"This is me eating my words.  I mocked those who reviewed McDonald's locations and now I myself am doing that exact same thing.  Here's where I will try to redeem myself as a Yelper - I am not reviewing their food as much as I am reviewing the decor.\n\nI will admit that McDonald's is a guilty pleasure of mine.  There are times their french fries call out to me in the night or I crave McNuggets dipped in sweet & sour sauce.  I may be drooling a bit right now, in fact.  What keeps me from frequenting there as I did in high school is both the knowledge of what goes into fast food and the fear of the oil and grease.  The fryer smell both draws and repulses me and I feel my skin getting greasy just from the proximity.  Nevertheless, if the call is strong enough, I will look beyond all that and get me a McMeal.  Such was the case recently.\n\nAfter an evening of wine sampling (\"wine tasting\" would imply that it was in small quantities, which it was not) my fiance awoke with a mean McCraving.  He is a recently reformed fast-fooder and had gone from frequent visits to the drive-thru to having avoided it for nearly a year.  We decided that if we were going to cave, we might as well check out the recently-leveled-and-rebuilt McDonald's.  Figuring that they were new enough that the fryer, exhaust fans, etc. would still be free of too much buildup, we ventured inside.\n\nThis is seriously the best decorated McDonald's I have ever been to.  It has a mid-century modern feel to it with retro chairs, patches of dark wood flooring and what I can only describe as raised-circle-in-a-square ceramic tiles surrounding the drink/napkin/ketchup area.  I can seriously see some of the design elements being incorporated into a cool modern home.  Flabbergasting is how out-of-place it is in that area of town, where most commercial makeovers seem to involve stucco and tan paint.\n\nWe ate our food in awe of our surroundings.  Was this the future of McDonald's eateries?  Or just a fluke?  I'm hoping it's the former.  If I'm going to stuff myself with fast food, it would be nice to at least do so in a visually-pleasing environment."}
{"text":"Had quite a few problems with this one late night morning staff is great. We just canceled an order cause the customer service was horrible we talked to a manager. I hope the service gets better I love McDonald's but won't put up with rude people."}
{"text":"This McDonald's needs some serious help from customer service. The manager melody should not be a manager but in the back peeling potatoes. They continuously get the order wrong and make customers wait 25-30 min for a redo. Go thru it yourself and see what I'm talking about . Melody's body language suggests she is burned out and does not hold the McDonald's core values."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service and extremely dirty. DO NOT EAT HERE. There are better options."}
{"text":"Awful service. The employees and supervisors just act like they don't want to be there. Stood In line then cashier just leaves and supervisors and other employees just ignore you."}
{"text":"Ordered food for myself as well as my mom. When I got home I found that I got a small nugget order, even though I paid for a large order. I immediately called them and spoke to a manager who assured me he would put my name in a book and that I can get a free order of the nuggets I was supposed to get on my next visit.\n\nFast forward a couple weeks later, I go in to get my nugget order, explain that I spoke to a manager about it and that he put my name in a book. She can't find my name and speaks with a manager on duty. They can't find my name either and tell the cashier to tell me I'm SOL. I then ask for the number for the franchise owner so I can call them. She gives me that number, I call and left a voicemail explaining everything and never get a call back.\n\nI'm done with ALL McDonalds now. I will never eat at one ever again just based on principal. The location on 35th Ave. and Peoria in Phoenix AZ should not get your business either. The only way places/people will learn, is when it hits them in the wallet. One person isn't going to do it, but I will tell all my friends and family not to go there, and if enough of you reading this stop going, maybe things will change. I will keep posting this message wherever possible to make them pay for their poor business practices and literally stealing money from me as a consumer!"}
{"text":"This McDonald's was rebuilt recently and is 24/7. I've not had any serious problems but every late night I come, either the ice cream or credit card machine is broken. WTF? How do you get out of line at that point, especially if someone's behind you? \n\nI've never seen a fast-food operation with as many credit card snafus as this place. I'm not sure which cc processor they're using, because I've heard \"cash only\" 5 of the past 7 times I've been through. I mean, it's fucking 2010 not 1999 with the Y2K bug. Just an FYI if you come here without cash between 12 and 5am."}
{"text":"Despite having only gone to this McDonald's through the drive through, I've ordered a few meals here for breakfast, lunch and dinner on multiple occasions. Based on the service and the food I had today, it was a good experience overall. \n\nThis McDonald's actually have two drive thru lanes that merge into one lane prior to checkout and food pick up. Definitely pay attention to the cars in the other lane so that you don't accidentally bump into each other. \n\nAt the first window is the checkout where you pay for food; here I was trying to use my iPhone for  Pay and unfortunately had no luck. Essentially, the cashier tried to scan my phone at first, before picking up the heavy payment machine for me to scan my phone on. For some reason, my card and the reader could not connect, so I ended up swiping a credit card instead. \n\nPulling up to the second window, I picked up my meal of chicken nuggets with a Sprite soda. The lady said she gave me BBQ sauce when I asked for Sweet & Sour (it said S&S on my receipt). So she handed me another S&S sauce which was nice (turned out I ended up getting 2 S&S sauce). \n\nSo in terms of food quality, the chicken nuggets tasted surprisingly crispy but the fries was slightly disappointing because it was cold. Overall in terms of McDonalds, it was decent and would return."}
{"text":"McDonalds are usually the same. I have to say, though, this is the best McDs location in the Madison area. Staff are always great, drive-through is fast, and I have never had an issue with a messed up order. There is also a built in play place for kids (those seem to be disappearing out of most McDonalds these days)."}
{"text":"This is a McDonald's.  The food tastes the same no matter which one you go to, and it's perfectly fine for a late-night fast food fix.  However, this one will never give you the correct food.  Even if employees outnumber patrons three to one, you had better open up every box to make sure you get what you ordered.  Not just look in the bag.  Look in the boxes.\n\nThe employees are friendly enough when you point out their mistakes.  It's not like they're maliciously screwing up your order.  But an order consisting of a Double Quarter-pounder with cheese (yes, that's TWO WHOLE PATTIES, WITH CHEESE), two apple pies and an order of fries should not be difficult to assemble.  You want an Angus burger?  It's a toss-up whether what comes on the burger is even close to what you ordered.  \n\nI don't want to think about what this place turns into during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"It's a McDonald's. What can I say. \nOur food came very quickly. The interior was very nice, consisting of booths, tables,high tables, a fireplace, and a play place. \nDined 6/6/2016."}
{"text":"Ok, we all know Mcdonalds is good for having to endure horrible attitudes, missing food and more attitudes when you complain. Well the first time I was right as usual lol! The lady who took my order was as rude and just plan ugh as she could be! I had to come back because she left out nearly everything I ordered. So I came back and she was like oh I apologize in such a somber voice and offered 3 dollar menu coupons (Take it they keft out almost 10 dollars worth of food). I took it and gave the manager a call the nest day and she was very apologetic and had me come in. She not only remade my order but asked me anything that I wanted and added it to it. All said and done I left out with almost 50 bucks of free food! So Kudos to them! Thanks!"}
{"text":"This Mc Donald's is always a long wait, the staff on 2nd shift into 3rd will make you wait for any food item without informing you of a wait, I waited on average 12 minutes in drive thru for 2 Mc Doubles and a small Coke, and the sandwiches were both cold so I brought them in and complained why I had cold food on a 14 minute DT wait when I was the first customer in the DT and 3 cars that ordered behind me left without their food. I asked the staff why it took so long and never got an answer or apology. The staff here also do not wear name tags to use to complain. The picture I will post here is the woman who is very rude always on 2nd shift into 3rd. The asks \"May I help you?\" As though you are worthless to her and not a customer. I will no longer come here or to any Mc Donald's in the area for fear of crappy service!"}
{"text":"I went there to get a frappe, it seemed like an average typical McDonalds.  Not a whole lot to expect being fast food."}
{"text":"I usually love going to McDonald's. We all have cravings for it sometime or another. However, within the last month I went into McDonald's and their hours online said it was open til 12. It was around 10:35 I went in and the manager said they were closed. They pushed me out the door and locked it behind me. Either they closed early because they are lazy or they are just rude... Probably both. I do not recommend going at night ever!"}
{"text":"I don't see how anyone can give McDonalds 5 stars.  Even if you have great service, its still McDonalds- the food ranges from acceptable to awful.  \n\nI waited a ridiculous amount of time for my food today.  I think it was 20 minutes in the drive through and there was no apology whatsoever.  Avoid this one folks."}
{"text":"Service was slower than a normal McDonalds. Just not overly impressed. Drink was somewhat flat. All in all, I wish I had driven another mile down the road. There were several other choices I could have made."}
{"text":"It's McDonalds, everyone has probably been to one at least once in their life. I've never had problems with this one. They have the double drive thru like most do now a days which makes things go faster. They do charge you sometimes for extra sauce which sucks, but it days right on their window \"additional charges for sauces and condiments.\" So you really can't get to upset.\n\nThe fries are always good and the new wraps are alright I'd recommend the chicken & bacon one."}
{"text":"It's McDonald's. What do you expect? Yelp is asking if this place has a TV. Do fancy menu boards count?"}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru on Halloween 2016 around 4:45 pm to order a couple of happy meals for my kids before trick-or-treating and handed the clerk a $20.  He turned away from me and as I stuck my hand out for my change he tried to tell me that I had only given him a $1.  The clerk called for a manager and then handed me back 'my' $1 and it was wet... ya, I keep my money in a wallet in my purse.  My money is not wet.  I was asked to come inside to clear things up.  They pulled and counted his cash drawer, but since he never opened it for my transaction, this was a waste of time.  I asked about the video and after nearly 40 minutes was told that \"the video is not good enough to show the denomination\" handed to the clerk.  It was then that they told me they could have the clerk empty his pockets.  Sure, because after 40 minutes he may still have the $20 he stole on him.....right.  That clerk stole from me.  The management, although polite, did not handle the situation well.  He should have had to empty his pockets immediately.  Stealing is stealing....and that young man stole from me and nothing was done about it!  I will never go back to that McDonalds and urge you to be VERY VIGILANT when you are paying your bill at that store!!!!"}

{"text":"I don't normally think of writing a yelp review for mcdonalds, but this one in particular is deserving of a five star review! I went through the drive thru and the woman was very pleasant on the speaker. I ordered a sausage mcmuffin with egg and a medium coffee and she tried to save me money by telling me I could get 2 mcmuffins for 3.33. She made sure that everything I ordered was correct and to pull to the first window. Did I mention how polite she was? The I went to the first window and paid, and the guy who was also polite asked me if I wanted to donate a dollar to the children fund. I went to the pick up window and the guy greeted me and gave me my food in also a polite manner! He hoped that I had a great day. \n\nThen I started eating, and the sausage mcmuffin I get in Chicago mcdonalds are usually greasy and oily and I have to be careful to keep lots of napkins around. This one, the muffin was toasted perfectly and melted cheese was just great and no oily mess! I enjoyed my breakfast.\n\nWhat makes me want to write this review is the people that work here were just so nice and pleasant! If killing them with kindness was what they were shooting for, I'd probably be dead!"}

{"text":"Worst McDonalds experience ever. Rude ignorant jerk behind the counter, the General Manager standing right next to him, GM said nothing, did nothing about the rotten employee. No greeting, just a dead rude stare, I asked for a meal, he said in a low negative antagonistic tone, \"What about it?!?\", like he was picking a fight.\nI realize minimum wage gets minimum effort employees, but wow McDonalds!!!!\nI will never go to this location EVER again.\nOh yeah, twice previously got tea that tasted like chemicals, like it was dish water, seriously and on 2 different occasions."}

{"text":"I usually don't check in or give reviews for fast food joints, but I came here after my PT appts and couldn't believe that McD's employees were actually friendly and efficient.  The one time I did go inside (btw I only get a large sweet tea when I do go) I was in shock that the inside was that clean!  I wish they could swap the employees with the ones on 24st and baseline in Phx."}
{"text":"Complete idiots. Went through the drive thru twice and they still couldn't get my drink order right. I guess a diet coke is too complicated for this McDonald's."}

{"text":"Long story short. My family and I went through the drive-thru. We were charged for the order before us along with our order. When trying to unravel the situation, we went to one blue shirt who had to go to another blue shirt, who then went to another blue shirt. Come on! Is it really that hard? I hate all McDonald's restaurants. I have never had a good experience at any of the ones I've been to. They will hire ANYBODY! I no longer eat at ANY of their joints.  There are too many other places to go to. I think it's sad that I have to give them at least one star. They deserve none."}
{"text":"This place is in serious need of a whole new crew. One time I was on my way to work stopped for a raspberry tea and what do they give me? Diet tea! Seriously. Idk why I have given them the benefit if the doubt multiple times but I'm done. Another time they completely messed up my order and so when I went in to let them know and asked for a manager, the manager went to the back of the store and would not come talk to me at all. She kept telling the cashier to help me. She was just a cashier! What kind of management does that!? Also don't waste your time trying to call their corporate office because you get nothing but a voicemail that is completely full! This place is a horrible excuse for a restaurant! As are most of the other fast food restaurants in the area."}

I sent my fish filet back because it didn't have extra cheese on it which I paid for and my tarter sauce look like she spit in it. Customer service is clearly at the bottom of the totem pole. The health department needs to make a pop visit ASAP I'm sure they have a few violations."}
{"text":"Mcdonalds is a fast food restaurant. So it's all about getting customers in and out. When I walked in there were flies everywhere but it didn't matter because I was taking food to go.\nWhen I waited by the register no one approached me or said anything. I waited for two minutes as the cashiers played on their phone by the takeout window and talk amongst each other. They looked at me but continued talking amongst themselves in Spanish in the corner. I left because if I had the time to wait I would have gone elsewhere no problem.  But seriously acknowledge customers if there's a issue. And if there is something wrong with the machines or a reason you can't service me, tell me. Or put a sign up explaining a reason. This location failed at being a convenience to customers and at being fast food."}
{"text":"Why is it that this McD's is THE WORST!!!! We waited 25min that's after ordering and in line to only be told that I have to park so that someone can bring my food, then to find out that my order was wrong so then had to wait yet again. I should have gone to Jack In The Box and The total time that I spent waiting at McD's I would have been hime and done eating. We have given then enough chances and the quality of service does NOT improve! The only thing that I can trust about this McD's is that they will take forever to get your food & that it will be wrong!!!"}
{"text":"Disgusting service and takes forever been here for an hour now just to get my order correct. Then the manager said to make sure I told the cashier the right items I told her I did it isn't my fault she isn't putting down what I'm asking for SMH. WORST SERVICE EVER."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. EXTREMELY RUDE. I got a month old toy and asked to change it because the NEW toys were out. However the manager was extremely RUDE and lied about being the manager because at first she said the manager was in the back. The toy wasn't the problem, a cheap $4 dollar toy can be bought anywhere. Its how they handled the situation. I was baffled at such terrible service and the restrooms are VERY dirty. Never going back ever. STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"Just f****** McDonalds sucks balls. F****** went in there to get some ice cream and they're all watching novela its slow as hell one cashier with 10 people in the line was one cashier and everyone standing around not doing s*** I don't drink I don't recommend this store for anybody unless you real hungry"}
{"text":"I went thru the drive thru and had the worst experience ever!! I pulled up at 12:30 pm and looked at the menu which still showed breakfast menu. I asked the guys if there serving lunch the response I received was mind boggling. He responded with \"(Chuckling) Before you ask me that kind of question why dont you look at the menu which will answer your question.\" When I told him it still showed breakfast he responded with \" F@#$ are you serious I cant F@#$ believe that\" followed with a chuckle. I asked what kind salads they had he responded with \" the kind with lettuce\" I order a salad and got it and left I was so mad. I came back to my office and called to speak to the manager named Alma just as bad. I was explaining to her what had happened and she kept trying to hang up on me and tell me that she was going to hang up to handle the person before I could tell her the story. I kept telling her I am not finished. When I was done she said bye and hung up. Called there corp office 3 times never got a phone call back so I emailed still nothing. So the owners are just as bad as there employees."}

{"text":"McDonald Manager threating my mom who is elder and disabled with her grandchildren in the car.... bet you didn't plan on my visit lil McChicken Shit.. talking sh*t and saying \"Im about to go off\" to her she came home crying. Your lucky you didnt set outside.  All this just for ordering a plain hamburger that you messed up the order on not once but twice...\n@McDonalds seems you train your managers and staff to act gangster and disrespect to elderly disabled grandmothers... well i hope you train them to get their *ass kicked. I will spread the word.  Corporate. BBB, health dept and make the news... whos the owner? Please help..."}
{"text":"They seriously need to do something about the loitering part at the drive through... That discourages me to even attempt to get some from there knowing there are strange people lurking in the corners... I bet they have drug deals going on outside in the parking lot and nothing changes... Change the atmosphere around and maybe you won't get worried customers... And stop over frying the fries..."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The lettuce in the salad looked like it had been frozen and unfrozen about 5 times before today. The manager was super rude and you can't get a side salad instead of fries, you have to order your sandwich and salad separately. Then I went to get water from the soda fountain to find out they don't have a water option. I had to go back to the counter where they proceeded to hand me a baby cup full of ice and a little water already \"pre-made\" in the refrigerator. Definitely will never come back here!!!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever!!!! I stopped by for something quick to eat, I pull up to the drive thru and the lady did not greet us. When I asked her a question, she sound as if she were annoyed. Once I finished ordering I pulled up to the first window, once again she did not greet us. She took my money and closed the window. I then pull to the second window the young man just gave us our food. We had no napkins, the grilled chicken was so old and dry, my husbands hot & spicy were cold and not appetizing. I called and a manager answered it sounded as if i were a teenager. You could tell that she did not know what to do and hung up on me."}
{"text":"Am I the only one with enough times where I get my order right! I always have a good drive thru experience, it really is helpful to have your payment ready."}
{"text":"This is the worst McDonald's in history. The girls have attitudes and the guys smoke weed all day.  I can't believe management lets them get away with this."}
{"text":"went in for coffee, which took them 25mins to get it to me! No since of care for the customer at all! Very bad service and all you are is cattle moving though the feed line!!"}
{"text":"I try to avoid this location at all costs. It seems like there is always a crazy line, no matter what time it is. They NEVER have ice cream or apple pies. They will mess your order up, it's almost a guarantee. Like someone else said, you might even have someone asking you for change while you're waiting to get to the payment window."}

{"text":"Girlfriend says \"Want McDonald's for lunch?\"\n\nI'm super hungry.  But I've been trying to do no fast food for Lent.  \n\nGirlfriend says, \"Oh yea, you weren't eating fast food yet, right.\"\n\nI see the golden arches in the distance.  Quickly slipping I say, \"Um, do we have food at home for lunch?\"  \n\nGirlfriend says, \"Not really, we need to go grocery shopping.\"\n\nI freaking kid you not, while we wait at the red light freaking church bells go off right behind us.  Yes, automated, on the hour church bells.  I couldn't make this stuff up.\n\nI say, \"Um......\"\n\nThe light becomes green and girlfriend says, \"Let's just get it.  We'll go shopping later.\"  \n\nI hadn't made the decision, so somehow that made it better.  I dove in with both feet. Bring on the Big Mac!!!  Coke has never tasted so cold or so good coming out of that giant straw.  \n\nAnd finally, in an act that could almost be a sign from the big G, the McDonald's that has never ever gotten our order completely right - got the whole thing perfect.  \n\nSo if you ever go here, and don't hear the church bells, check your order before you pull away from the drive through as in the past this location actually gave us 2 double cheeseburgers with no meat."}
{"text":"If I could do negative stars I would. 3 strikes you're out. 3rd time I come here and the service is SLOW, unprofessional and the lot are out of ice and tea. The worst McDonald's I've EVER been too. Got to 24th & Baseline instead!!!"}
{"text":"1 hour wait for 2 egg mcmuffins? What the hell is wrong with this place! Worst service I've ever had anywhere"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this with zero stars. This is literally the most unprofessional McDonald's there is. It takes 30 minutes to get your food and literally every single time I've gone, the order is ALWAYS wrong. My fianc√© decided to go get me some food and the employees were doing burnouts in the parking lot and the manager and all the employees were watching something on the tv and ignoring all of the customers. Seriously, McDonald's is supposed to be cheap fast food and I wouldn't even spend one dollar on this lousy place. Someone needs to get better employees. They have garbage employees and a garbage manager. This whole place is garbage. Don't waste your money. No wonder they have an overall of two stars. Shouldn't even be one."}
{"text":"No matter how many times i go or repeat the order, somehow they screw up and never do it right, stopped going for about 7 months and decided to give it one more try... dissapointed again.."}
{"text":"Apperently McDonald's does not serve lunch until 11am. I pulled up to place my order at 10:58am and the attendant says WE DO NOT SERVE LUNCH UNTIL 11 SIR. I was like we are two minutes away just take my order please and she refused to do so. That's the most stupidest thing ever.  Worst McDonald's ever."}
{"text":"So i went to the same mcdonalds again on central/southern and praying everyday that the mcdonalds on 19ave/ baseline opens up really soon just because iam hoping they have better customer service skills. So i went yesterday ordered 2 large fries 20peice nuggets and a big mac. When i pulled up to the window and they gave me my food they gave me no sauce no ketchup and no napkins? Then i waited there after i got my food and sasquash opens up the window again like if saying \"what am i still doing here\". I was like \"can i get sum ketchup, sauce for my chicken nuggets and napkins? and she gives me this look that made think about putting my hands up to protect my face as if she was going to strike at me from a distance because i asked for too much! So i left and thought to myself who in their right mind will approve mcdonalds employees get paid $15 dollars  an hour and dont even have people skills. Like i said before you get better customer service at a hot dog stand."}
{"text":"The kids that work here are uneducated with lots of attitude. I asked for a double hamburger, so they gave me a mcdouble?? I don't understand how one can misunderstand this! Then they want to stand there and say its they same thing. I shouldn't have to ask for a mcdouble with no cheese if asking for a double hamburger should make sense right!! The only thing that made this trip worth anything was the manager that was super nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Got down to my last chicken nugget and found what seems to be a hair. Kinda disappointed but it's mcdonalds. What can you expect. Got to love Cleveland."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!!!rude, ignorant !! Michelle rushed me in the driveway had a cocky attitude and wasn't even in dress code. I won't be back this place needs to get it together!!!"}
{"text":"Ick. Whenever I am desperate enough to stop here on the way home from work it's a regrettable experience. Indifferent service (with attitude), lengthy wait times (isn't this supposed to be \"fast food\") resulting in poor food quality (not fresh, lukewarm at best) and an overall feeling of regret for once again getting suckered in for a supposedly quick, tasty meal. \n\nThe lady who \"proudly owns and operates\" this franchise needs to get more hands-on and fix this place or sell it and let the chain operate it to acceptable standards."}
{"text":"We went in on Sunday evening at 8:30 pm. There was no one in the restaurant. We ordered dinner, and they said the credit card machine wasn't working. It was fine, I paid in cash. The food was very stale, dry burgers and cold cardboard fries. The food was old. I wonder if this gang closed the restaurant early and took cash for old food as a way to pocket the money. When it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck..."}
{"text":"My wife is fond of McDonalds, so we've been to this location three times.  EVERY SINGLE TIME, they have screwed up the order.  The third time, I repeated at least four times \"No cheese.\"  And, of course, we were rewarded with ...cheeseburgers.  The staff here just wants to process the customers and get them out.  They don't care about actually giving you what you order."}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's in town! I waited over 10 minutes (with 1 truck in front of me) for some old, cold, french fries with a piece of fish on a bun which they called a Filet-O-Fish.  GROSS food mixed with UNPLEASANT attitudes. Save your money or go next door and give Wendy's a try."}
{"text":"4 customers and 6 employees. Slow as it can get service. Place is filthy dirty. Struggled to find a clean table. Fryalator alarms sounding the entire time. Employees either to dumb to turn them off or they just did not give a crap. Keep driving and find something better. How they stay in business is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie to you: my new addiction is the McDonald's breakfast dollar menu. Scoff if you want (and you should) -- I did too when I first saw the little pop-up ad on the Weather Channel site. \n\n\"Come on,\" I said. \"A dollar for a breakfast sandwich? How crappy will that be?\"\n\nCue to a record scratching and me being both late for work and starving. I picked up a small coffee and a Sausage McMuffin (a McMuffin without the \"egg\" part) at the drive-through and wolfed that mother down while trying to also navigate the snowy streets of Beachwood. Yes, I am that asshole that eats and drives at the same time.\n\nI am now a convert. That dollar thing was damn tasty. That is all."}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday with my sister to get lunch for my nephew since we were out shopping. He is 2 so we decided to go inside to eat. My first time I've ever been to this mcdonalds. We get inside and go to order and the older lady working the front counter was rude and dident seem like she wanted to be there. The fries tasted like they were cooked 30 mins ago So i asked for fresh fries. Went to get ketup out of the pump it was empty s9 I went back to the counter to let them know and was told you need to tilt the front of it I explained again it was out of ketup finally was given packets. We sat in the booth area which was disgusting it looked like it hadn't been swept or moped in days tables were dirty. From the outside looks very nice but the inside is just plan gross and gives mcdonalds and very bad name. I will never be back they need to clean it up."}
{"text":"The real all natural Idaho Potatoes the french fried Frites are amazing. The fresh grass fed beef burgers and locally baked buns are always fresh and clean. The crew are fast and always friendly."}
{"text":"For McDonalds this is pretty nice.  Free wifi and flat screens.  Updated exterior.  Food was fast and fresh. Again it's a McDonald but a nice one."}
{"text":"This one has a lot of attitude towards the customer. The employees should take time off and go to a customer relations class to learn how to serve the public appropriately!And also serving warm breakfast. Nothing like a bacon egg cheese biscuit with cold cheese!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Both times were a bad experience. This last time they screwed up my order and forgot the nugget sauce in the drive through. I went back in to clear it up and the girl at the register was chatting with a guy and proceeded to put her phone number in his phone. I waited several minutes while this was going on. Service was slow, the employees are rude, and it is unclean. Oh...and the girl cooking had her underwear hanging out the back of her pants in that very cool \"urban\" style. You are better off getting a sandwich at a gas station than going here."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible, the dining room was filthy, trash everywhere, barely any clean tables. So slow this could not ever be considered fast food and no manager in sight to let know about these issues, trash overflowing"}
{"text":"Horrible worst mcdonalds,in the county. They goof my order up every time here.do not come here its bad."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here ever and I didn't bother reading the reviews first, just so it didn't taint my experience.  I LOVED the place.  Fast friendly service!  Clean and neat!  Flat screen TV in the biggest common area.  This place actually got more business through the drive-thru and left the dining area inside very quite and pleasant.\n\nThere's no playroom so my kids were disappointed, but I have a very good, overall experience and would come back next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Mickey D's in the city. With no in in line today and only 5 people in the restaurant, my simple order of a McChicken and double cheese burger took 9 minutes. Cashier seemed very distracted. Pretty sure she was the manager. Very chaotic. Dining room filthy. Chicken was fried for like 6 minutes. This place needs help badly!"}
{"text":"one of my fav McDonald !\nFREE WIFI!\ngood service :)"}
{"text":"In terms of McDonalds, this was a little on the slower side. I ordered my breakfast standard chicken biscuit and it took over ten minutes for us to get it. Sure it was the breakfast rush, but how do you run out of a staple menu item?\n\nrest of the meal is ok, large dining area, well kept bathrooms, trash cans were overflowing though. Parking lot was large enough. Easy access to chagrin/271, and the beachwood area."}
{"text":"Good food, great lobby.\n\nI just wish they were opened for 24 hours.  I drive in from Boston sometimes\nand am in the area at midnight, and they are closed :-(\n\nPlease, stay opened just for meeeee!!!  :-)"}
{"text":"The ONLY reasons that I gave this place even two stars is because the fries were hot and the iced tea was OK... Every time I end up there, I think that \"this time will be different\"... wrong. Even after their lunch rush (around 2pm) the drive-thru takes forever. The service is slloooow. I was told to drive up to a wait area even after taking forever to order (2 cars in front of me) and waiting long even after paying at 1st window.. After about another 5 minutes, I parked and made it to the door when \"Lazy\" came out with my bag and said \"I didn't make it!\" when I complained \"what part of FAST in FAST-food don't you people get?\" Par for the course, I get back on the freeway... Order is WRONG... AGAIN!!!! I'm on the Eastside a bunch for work and am 100 percent done with this joint! The one on Mayfield Rd in Mayfield Hts is awesome and gets everything right every time. Maybe it was the Lord saying \"quit eating fast-food!\""}
{"text":"Awful experience with their drive thru!! Waited 15mins for sweet tea & chicken snack wrap  happens every time I go to this location"}
{"text":"Came here at 4 am for a quick bite with my cousin, 2 Sausage Egg Mcmuffins for $3.60??? When did this deal come out? But honestly, I worked at McDonald's and I can tell if the food has been sitting for awhile, but no, the Mcmuffin was freshly made, bread eggs and for the sausage it's been prepared but still, I'm not gonna wait 3 minutes just for that I just wanted a quick bite before we head home to sleep. I was extremely satisfied on my first visit, review is subject to change. But for now easy 5/5!"}
{"text":"McDonalds is good anywhere but it's the location you need to know. This location is dirty, it's inside a gas station. The parking lot is sketchy and people outside asking for hand outs. All that was during the day can't imagine at night."}
{"text":"I needed a quick bite to eat and McDonald's presented itself at the most opportune moment.  This location isn't in the best area and I normally wouldn't have stopped by. I opted to order from the drive-thru and was surprised at how friendly the employees were. The wait time was very minimal and I was on my way in no time."}
{"text":"Not that I try to eat at a McDonald's often at all.... but I bring my kids to eat so we can use the playground. 9 out of 10 times I've tried to visit here they are \"cleaning the playground\" while my toddler and other people's children are crying or fussing for it to be open again. They made no effort to hurry or maybe trying to clean it at a time of day when they don't have frequent customers. Won't go to this location anymore."}
{"text":"At 12:26 Am on 9-12-16 I ordered $15  worth of food and the lady in the drive through refused to give me one single ranch. She then rudely closed the door on me as I was asking nicely for one sauce. At no point was I rude to her but she was extremely rude and looked very irritated. I was expecting a little more customer service and not to feel belittled when getting my food. Hopefully corporate will do something about her attitude but I doubt they will. I'm going to let all my friends know to not go to this McDonald's they don't deserve our business."}
{"text":"So I just decided we needed McDonald's and after driving to the second and furthest from our house. We decide to do tye McPick. And after sorting out the titals for each. The bring it to the 2nd window with a strange \" bye have a good night\".\nNow I know why\nWeak Fries\nCold sandwiches \nSo I drove back through advised them of this, tje really did not care nor go above and beyond. \nAnd the same juvenile smartass did a fast handover and walk away.\n\nThis place is an early morning time suck.\nNext day issue still not sitting well with me I drove 5 miles to hear \"if you would have called last night we would give you your money back... sorry \".\nMore than annoyed I left...\nHandled arrends and still not happy drove back and just asked ro have 2 combo meals for my son.\nBipriduct of a father who graduated from Hamburg University 1983.\n\nI will make sure to Never drive or walk in."}
{"text":"One I go to when I need my egg McMuffin fix. This location is a little dated. They have been very consistent on my orders. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Bad store. Absolutely awful drive through. I live not too far from this location and have come to it for food over the years. Each time, over quite some time, I've been horribly disappointed by the drive-up service - today was no exception.  The food is McD's, what more need be said except that this time the burger tasted old and the fries were stale. Its one thing to wait 15 minutes when there are only two cars ahead of you and another to get crappy food once you finally get to the window. \n\nI've been here enough times to say with confidence: Avoid this place."}
{"text":"FIRE THE ENTIRE NEW STAFF MY GOD.\nthe drive thru takes exceptionally long and by the time you get to the window you are greeted with a poor attitude from some angsty ass teenager and an incorrect order. Now I've visited this location quite often as I do live down the street and I must say ever since the remodel and new staff I have had 9/10 orders wrong. Honestly I go out of my fucking way to go to other McDonalds.. avoid this shithole.  \nsorry dudes.. 0 fucking  stars."}
{"text":"My kids and I just finished eating here.   It wasn't busy and there was a full staff.  A couple of, management staff (I assume because they had blue shirt and ties) were up front.  One took my order, while the other worked with staff to get them setup.  We got our meal and it was in decent time.  The order was correct except for missing sauce for my daughter McNuggets.  My problem with this McDonalds was the cleanliness.  The drink area was filthy, hadn't been wiped down for some time and the whole time we were there.  When we looked for a seat, not one was clean.  My kids wiped off our table with sanitizing wipes and napkins.  It's a shame, because this is a brand new building they put in place of the old one, and it's already going to crap."}
{"text":"I miss the old building and staff. I have been frequenting this location since the 80's and even worked there a short time when I was in high school. \n\nEvery since they opened up the new building with new staff it simply hasn't been the same. The seating area is smaller, the play area for the kids is a joke compared to the old one and the place just lacks any charm.\n\nWhen I do decide to visit their ice cream machine is always down and or unavailable. The credit machine is down. I simply just visit other McDonald's when I am in the mood for their food."}
{"text":"My now go-to pit stop McD's for a quick caffeine and sugar fix. Haven't had a fast food coffee in a while and needed to get a jump start on the day without breaking the bank. This is a drive-thru review:\n\nOrdered an Iced Hazelnut Coffee, parfait and sausage breakfast burritos. Fast and friendly service from the gal working in the drive thru. The service was fast and I did not have to wait long at all. All my food was given and they even separated my parfait from my hot food. Upon first sip of my iced coffee, you can insert the surprised face emoticon here, and my instant response was YAASSS McDonalds! Hellooo, coffee. Hi, Hazelnut flavor. It was legitly good for coffee less than $2. The parfait was just as I remembered, sweet vanilla yogurt, syrupy sweet fruit and a sachet of granola- did not go well for my greek yogurt accustomed tongue. The sausage burritos tasted best covered in the Spicy Hot Sauce or McDonald's belief to be salsa. Filled with cheese, scrambled egg and bits of sausage encased in a soft flour tortilla ... it should be called a cheesy egg burrito instead. However, for $1 I suppose I can't complain too much.\n\nThis location also looks very modern and clean from the exterior with such a convenient location on the corner. Cheap food as always and pretty damn good coffee, damn McDonald's who knew you evolved into this! Hello, new pit stop for coffee!"}
{"text":"I bought a large FF but got the equivalent of a medium. They are cutting corners to save money. FILL Up the Large Box I paid for!"}
{"text":"I want to be fair to this business and don't want to have one negative experience influence the way I look at it, but really, today was pretty terrible customer service.\n\nI have gone to this store for about 5 years, at least weekly, if not daily.  Most of the time, the food is McDonald's food and the service is wonderful.  The staff that they had before the remodel was, in my humble opinion, more concerned with things than this current staff, especially based on today's experiences.\n\nI have been ordering the Grilled Chicken Asian salad, which comes with ginger dressing and a packet of almonds all wrapped up together.  I've noticed that the lettuce may not be the most fresh, but I pick out the bad lettuce and continue on (and no, I've not ever complained to the restaurant about that).\n\nToday, I ordered my salad, came back to work and there was no packet with plastic-ware or dressing or almonds.  When I called the store, I spoke to Bianca, who claimed to be the manager.  I told her my tale of woe and these were my choices - \n1.  drive back to the store (not possible - I spent most of my half-hour lunch picking up my salad).\n2.  she would give me a coffee drink on my next visit.\n\nI didn't feel as if that were an equitable exchange - a lunch I couldn't eat for a coffee!  lol  I felt that the store should replace my lunch (that I couldn't eat with no plastic-ware).  She then offered a lemonade or any drink of my choice.  I refused, of course.  I must say that she was very pleasant while she offered me these non-choices.\n\nFair is fair.  I wasn't asking for more than I paid for, but honestly, I couldn't even eat the food that I had!\n\nI will not be returning to this store.  Thanks, Bianca!  I see how much you care for  your customers!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to McDonald's locations.  I'm a regular to this particular McDonald's; enough for me to be recognized by most of the staff and several of the managers.  It's got a clean interior, good prices, and, for the most part, a friendly staff.  \nI'm not a big fan of most of the food that the McDonald's franchise sells but I go to McDonald's often for their coffee and blended beverages.\nThere are times when someone will get your order wrong or ring you up incorrectly, but they are very quick to resolve any issues."}
{"text":"This McDonalds is awful.  Not sure why I continue to go there.  They are either always out of ice cream or their machine is broke.\n\nDrive thru is ridiculously slow especially late nights.  \n\nOrder is often wrong....they don't always give out commonly used things like napkins, ketchup, straws unless you ask"}
{"text":"One of the worst McDonalds ever....used to be such a nice neighborhood place, loved taking my daughter here for rewards....then they remodeled, and it's been a nightmare ever since....the worst customer service, they always get the orders wrong, if you point that or ask for something they forgot, they act like it's such an inconvenience.....everything takes longer....the only positive I can say is the cashiers taking the orders are good...after that, forget it!  Nothing but problems every single time you go in!  Anytime I go here now someone is asking to speak to a manager,.....it has gone so downhill.  I wish we still had the old building and old crew back here!  I'll drive down to other locations now just to avoid this one."}
{"text":"I came here in search of something to fill a deep longing for a drink to quench my thirst. I thought a large cool iced dr. Pepper would fulfill my needs. I paid my $1.08. Then I slowly rolled to the next window. My hopes were high. The lady looks so happy as she handed my cold drink with a wrapped clean straw. I pulled up forward with nothing but joy. I ripped that paper covering off my straw with my teeth. My mouth was watering. My straw penetrated through the hole of my plastic lid. I took a long chug of soda. And it tasted terrible. It made my heart drop. A slow tear ran down my face. I look at my drink and realized it is not what I wanted. I wanted a coke instead. Very disappointed but shall return."}
{"text":"We went to this McDonald's this evening for dinner, we walked into the door, there was signs posted all of the drink station said there were no sodas. We did not realize until we were ordering, is that meant that all of the water was out. All of the water in the building. Since we were there, we chose to go eat anyways and had to purchase a bottle of water. They had no way of compensating the difference in the value meals, without the drink. Once I was finished eating there. It dawned on me, how are they washing their hands? How are they cleaning anything? How are the toilets being flushed? And how are the customer supposed be washing their hands? All of this is quite unsettling to me, and I do not suggest you going here."}
{"text":"Not sure what it is with this location but anytime you go there after 1am nothing works. They either can't accept CC or don't have whatever it is you're ordering. Literally anything. I've tried multiple times and it's always a disaster and if they do happen to have something after having to ask what they have rather than what they don't as it's easier that way they still manage to mess it up. With such a prime location you'd think they'd be on the top of their game."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes at the drive thru. Mid-way through the wait, the worker told me I was waiting on the fries. Didn't even get a \"sorry for the long wait\" or actually anything said at all when they handed me the food. Terrible experience. Fries tasted a little off too."}
{"text":"The manager was nice enough to plug my phone into the ceiling because it was dead... He even climed atop the chairs to do so."}
{"text":"Hey I know it's fast food but fast food doesn't mean the food should be gross or how it was ordered this is the worst location I have ever been to I will give the one star to the star of the location the cashier collecting money great personality pleasant and quick so she gets the one star I gave. Now let's talk about I ordered quarter pounder deluxe with no pickles no may no cheese guess what I got all of what I didn't order  the tag was right but the burger wasn't by the time I dug off all the incorrect stuff I got one side bun and the meat nothing else was edible now let's talk about the fries that were half empty old hard and overcooked unedible. They did get my hi c orange right woohoo so did I get my money worth even in the world of fast food hell no will I come back hell no since this is my third time and each time has been worse then the time before. Oh wait I forgot the girl at the window who practically threw the bag at me after she handed me my drink sheesh was she rude!!  So everyone I'm sure these guys must have at least a few good days but is it worth taking that chance?  Not for me it isn't there are too many other places I can go"}
{"text":"Let's just say I will not be coming to this McDonald's because they do not carry shakes and they are rude when you ask."}
{"text":"Ok this is a \"classic\" mcDonalds... What that means I dunno... But I can tell you that the quality of food here is a lot better than the \"other\" mcDonalds hot salty fries...yum! And there is just something special about McDonald's coke...it tastes better. And they have a Summer deal where any size soft drink including sweet tea is 1 dollar!"}
{"text":"Good customer service fresh food ...dinning room clean ,staff was nice and respectable I will come again"}
{"text":"I saw the rating of this station, couldn't believe it has a 4-5 rating because in my opinion it is not. Customer service  sucks, spent over 5 minutes waiting for someone to take my order and I only ordered sausage mcmuffin with egg and hash brown, both served to me warm and hot (only good kudos to this place).  Electrical outlets for your electronic devices to be plugged in for charging are located on the ceiling, restrooms are completely monitored, you have to asked workers working the register to electronically let you in, not good if you have a \"emergency\" and the food server is busy helping others.  By the way even the soda fountain machines is also closely monitored, you have to ask the workers to press a trigger button to let you dispense beverage and ice.  \n\nWhile I was finishing reviewing this place, I saw a lady struggling to enter the females restroom, I kindly pointed the situation to the manager who happens to be working the front register.  Same lady asked to be let in, in response the manager said just push your way in, what a dishonest manager.  The restrooms don't have signs letting customers know to ask to be entered in, \n\nGoing back to the soda fountain, if you don't want people helping themselves get free refills, a suggestion is to relocate the soda fountain behind the cash register counter so you as an employee can better monitor for people askin for a refill and charge them for it instead going back to push the trigger button to allow people to dispense beverage.  It saves time especially when business is busy, just saying."}
{"text":"Guess if they have a shift change you can't order for 30 minutes.. I got here at 1:30am after work.. But for reals does it really take that long I worked in fast food too and it never took that long ugh"}
{"text":"Service is nothing to write home about. They're not friendly. The food was cold. It's kind of busy too so the food probably shouldn't be cold. Only went here because it was close to my son's doctor's office. :/"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews about fast food joints... In fact, I don't normally EAT at fast food joints. \n\nI pulled into the drive-thru for a quick chicken sandwich before a movie. I ordered my food, nothing crazy, just a crispy chicken sandwich with a little ranch added. I pulled up behind a car at the second window and then WAITED FOR TEN MINUTES. I know that isn't a huge amount of time, but what the hell were they doing in there? It's McDonald's! It's supposed to be super fast! When I finally got to the window, it was then another almost five minute wait. I asked the guy what was going on and said \"there was a mixup with my food\". Huh? You mean my lonely little chicken sandwich with ranch and pickles? Jeez, sorry to confuse you all!\n\nWell, i finally got it, with like 5 minutes to spare before my movie. There was barely any ranch on it and it was cold. Blech.\n\nThis just reinforces why I never eat at crappy places like this. I guess it's my own fault."}
{"text":"Great 50s decor ambiance and exceptional service. Very clean and fresh food. Glad to see a manager take so much pride. Other McDs should learn from this one. Will come again for sure."}
{"text":"Can't figure out quite what the meat tastes like, definitely not beef. They can't seem to put the burgers together right cheese off to the side sometimes sauce sometimes not and yet these people want $15 an hour when they can't do their job as they're supposed to. If they want better money maybe they should get a better education and get a real job."}
{"text":"The manager here by the name of David needs to get fired ASAP. Worst customer service ever. He actually refused to give me and my girl ice waters in 110 degrees and we were with a kid. Never before have I been denied ice waters in Arizona before. This McDonalds has officially lost me as a customer. What he did has to be illegal. He actually told us \"I am denying you services right now\". If you ask me I think he was racist. He claimed to be native american but I highly doubt that he is. We went at 9:40pm on June 26, 2016."}

So I ended up with a grilled cheese english muffin...\n\nI guess I should in some way thank them for pushing me one step closer to being the vegetarian I occasionally toy with becoming. My stomach is still churning at the memory of wet egg in my mouth. *hork*"}
{"text":"I love this mcDonald's not just for its food but for it's 50's decor and ambience. One of the nicest Micky D's I've ever been in, for one thing. It is well kept up and maintained and their staff is top-notch. \n\nI love their food and whenever I am in the area, I come for the Saturday car shows. That is one big highlight this location offers and it's free and fun. \n\nIf you're into classic cars, come check out their show and grab a bite to eat at this fine restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning, and a roach crawled up my leg while sitting at my table. Went in the bathroom to get it off, and they were all over the place. Disgusting! Never eating here ever again."}
{"text":"Time for a review update.  I still love this place for the Saturday car shows, they get 5 Stars for that.  It's the longest running car show in Arizona I believe.  It's so much fun and it's free.\n\nThey get a bump up in stars because over the past 2 yrs, they've delivered great customer service and the food is always fresh by fast food standards.  Also, McDonald's has stepped up it's menu and offered a variety of new items that are tasty and unique.  Their Iced Coffee is very good...and I'm not a Coffee drinker.\n\nI come here primarily for breakfast and an occasional lunch....and the car shows.\n\nIf you have a free Saturday night and like cars, give it a try....especially during the nice weathered months.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"McDonald's has french fries no one can beat. McDonald's has fast service and polite employees. They are trying to get multiple healthy choices on the menu. They are also raising money to help the Ronald McDonald house and children with cancer achieve there dreams.McDonals has very creamy soft severe ice cream and is UNDERPRICED only 69 cents. It is decorated fabulously and I spent a lot of time looking around\n\n\nHowever the food can contain a lot of grease, the grease is why the food is so good but also why the food is unhealthy.\n\nOverall this McDonald's is awesome."}
{"text":"Lol Watch \"Food Inc\" Then try to eat here ok? lMFAO :-)"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by here (for the first time) last week for a quick fix. I'm not sure if this was an isolated incident, but this was not up to par with the consistency that I would expect eating at any other golden arches restaurant. In fact, both my Big Mac and my girlfriend's were surprising dry! I'm sorry but the secret sauce was not enough to save them! To top it off, we order combos and they really skimped out on the fries (the french fry containers were not overflowing full as I'm used to getting from other Mickey Dee's). \n\nAlso, since they were new and for a \"limited time\" (and thank the man upstairs for that), we tried out the McBites instead of our usual McNuggets, only to find ourselves in utter disappointment. The McBites were super dry and very hard with very little meat to be found. They were more like fried batter that were sitting too long under a heat lamp. I'm not sure if I'd ever give this location a try again, there were just too many strikes in one instance. Moreover, we went through the drive-thru so it's not like we could've complained to the manager if we ate inside. Overall, this was a bad first impression at this location."}
{"text":"When we lived in Chicago, one of the fun things our kids always enjoyed after a trip to the Adler or Science Museum was a visit to the \"Rock 'N Roll McDonalds\" on Clark Street.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/rock-n-roll-mcdonalds-chicago\n\nWell, this is our own mini Arizona version of that Mickey Ds.\n\nMost fast food places can only aspire to Three Stars in my book, given their uniform bland sameness.  The only differentiation are the employees or the theme/setup of the restaurant. How many of us like In 'n Out just for the ambiance?  \n\nI'm not saying the folks who make the Animal Style have anything to worry from the Oakbrook crowd.  But, this Mickey Ds is fun. It even has pictures (not labeled) of the first restaurant that Ray Kroc built in Des Plaines, IL  It also has baseball cards, and other collectibles throughout the restaurant.  Nice!\n\nAll of the employees who work here seem to care and work hard at keeping the place clean and nice.\n\nSo in Yelp-ese, yes they're \"Three Stars, A-OK\". They check all the boxes to earn those three stars.  But, I would say they deserve an extra half star for it being interesting and fun, as well."}

{"text":"So I had the pleasure of visiting the McDonald's on Middle Ridge Rd. in Lorain. I must say, I have never dined in a more \"cheerful\" environment. Seriously, I've had a more pleasurable and positive experience during military in-processing. This place makes the BMV look like Chuck-E-Cheese's.   So, during my morning commute, I decided to partake in the quality food that we've all come to expect at McDonald's. The drive-thru line was obnoxiously long (as always during breakfast), so I decided to order inside. There's where I met her. Her name was Lulu. The very air around this girl was ice cold, and I'm pretty sure that I saw some type of demonic aura around her as the people in front of me ordered their food. Not once did she ever make eye contact with the customers, and I'm thankful for this as I'm pretty sure that one look into her medusa-like eyes would have resulted in their very soul to be sucked out of their body.  My turn came to order and I tried to do what others feared to. I smiled and said \"Hello, how are you?\". I sat in wait for about 5 seconds (but felt more like 5 years) but received no response. Finally, I was met with a gaze that would have turned lesser men to stone. Lulu angrily responded with \"Yeah?!\". The boom of her voice echoed throughout the dining room and caused holy men to pray and children to cry. Who was I to deny this deity of fast food my order? I quickly responded with \"A #10 with a Coke to go\". Perhaps my prompt order spared me from being cut down by the merciless Lulu.   As she slammed her fingers into the register keys, I waited with bated breath for Lulu to read back my order and total. The amount due popped up on the register screen and Lulu sat in silence, like the calm before a tempest. I quickly pulled out my wallet and handed her majesty the cash. Lulu grabbed the bills out of my hand, and I'm pretty sure that if my grip on them would have been any tighter, I would no longer have my right arm. She then proceeded to stuff the money in the draw and slam down my change on the counter along with my receipt.  Without saying a word, Lulu walked away from the register and disappeared into the back. I could tell that the other employees either respected or feared this matriarch of McDonald's as they stumbled to step aside as she made her way through. Much like an enlisted person would stand at attention as an officer passes.  Another employee handed me my food and I left, luckily to escape with my life.  So overall, my experience here was deplorable. I originally wanted to complete the survey for this store on the McDonald's site, but apparently this one is so crappy that it doesn't even register as a valid store #. Lulu needs an attitude adjustment or another career, but she will more than likely become a store manager. I will never eat here again, and I strongly urge anyone reading this to heed my warning. You may not be so lucky."}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru and they were pretty fast. No complaints. I got in and out in less then 5 minutes (which compared to some drive thrus in the area that is super fast)."}
{"text":"Update to my previous review:  I contacted McDonald's Corporate to let them know about the service at this particular McDonald's - I received an e-mail from customer service within 24 hours saying that they had contacted the franchise.  Three days later I received a letter in the mail from the franchise owners apologizing for what happened and saying that they are taking action.  I really appreciated the quick response from both corporate and the owners, so I'm updating my star rating for them."}
{"text":"This restaurant in Ocotillo area  appears to be very poorly managed.  Just moved in to this area and have given this location several visits.\nThe employees can't smile, takes them forever to greet at the speaker,I received the wrong salad - called them from home - mgr said come back mention my name and we will replace the salad for you.  i went back the following evening and they flat out refused  to do anything- sorry we don't if this happened or not- the mgr is off today. Unbelievable!!!very poor training and employees don't care-most likely the mgr doesn't care either."}
{"text":"If there is one car in the drive-through ahead of you you will end up waiting five minutes to get your order. This is the slowest McDonald's in the country probably. Why corporate doesn't come down on this place is unbelievable. I went one time inside and ordered and it took them five minutes to make my order unacceptable.  What happened to fast food."}
{"text":"My first time here and will be the last time bathroom was messy kids screaming old people yelling at each other oh didn't get my order right and table was messy"}
{"text":"We went here and they messed up my 3 kids orders and 2 adult orders. So I called in and was promised a replacement order when I came back in. But when I went back in they told me they would not replace the order and their policy is you have to bring back the food to get it replaced but none of this was told to me when I called in about the screwed up order and had the name of the person who told me this over the phone and it was even written in their office book for order replacement and they refused to replace the order after making me sit and wait for 45 minutes just to tell me this. \nThis was not the first time they had screwed up our order either. Anyone who has allergies and wants ordered food accordingly don't go here as they don't make the order correctly and what you get home and open your order up and see it is made wrong and you call them and they say that next time you come in it will be replaced and you have the receipt with name of person you spoke to and they even write it in the office book don't expect it to actually happen and you will sit forever to find this out when they have maybe 1 or 2 customers.  \nI have never been forced to bring food back to get it replaced. Especially when you have hungry kids who have school the next day and so your not gonna make them wait longer to eat so you can take the food back that the place screwed up completely on. Your gonna call in and good customer service places say we will replace it next time you come in and actually do what they say. Then your gonna do what you can so your kids can eat quickly cuz your kids are starving right. \nI see why this location has only 2 and a half stars it should be zero."}
{"text":"8 am and lots to do on a busy Saturday and I am starving. Decided to swing by McDonalds for a hot breakfast this morning. There are like 9 people working like crazy running all around and I am the only customer inside??\nAfter waiting like 7 and a half minutes, I say to myself who needs breakfast this bad, and I left. \nDo yourself a favor McDonalds and close the inside counters and dining area and just run the drive thru with 6 kiosks, at least they acknowledge their customers."}
{"text":"Vanilla Shake and Chicken Nuggets and of course a Mcdouble hamburgers is my JOE's favorite. We come here when we get the opportunity."}

{"text":"This is a story about \"going the extra mile\"...\n\nWhich is exactly what I do when I drive an \"extra mile\" down the road to a different McDonald's location, instead of going to this, closer, more convenient one.\n\nEVERY single time I have gone to this location they have messed something up. Wrong orders, forgotten items, miss-charged credit cards, are just a few of the things that this collection of knuckleheads consistently excels at. \n\nSave yourself some frustration, and go the extra-mile...down the road."}
{"text":"If you need to go to McDonald's I suggest driving a mile up the road. This is probably the slowest fast food restaurant I have eaten at. The last straw was while waiting for my food in the drive through one of the managers was changing trash but after he was done he didn't wash his hands and just put my food in the bag to give. I told them I was not accepting it and they at least made me fresh new food."}

{"text":"so every so often, and it doesn't happen very much, my body craves that  trans fat haven known as the fancy pants scottish restaurant, Mac Donald's.  last night was my semi-annual craving.  and on my way to meet a friend at the bar, i stopped by the lakewood 117th location.\n\nthey did not help a sista out in her greasy fast food fantasy.\n\ni order a mcnugget meal.   i mean, yeah, i don't want to think about what pieces parts i'm really eating.  i just want to taste that generic mcdonalds chicken and eat my fries in fattening happiness.  the girl in the drive thru looked a bit confused.  regardless, as i start to pull away i look in the bag.  \n\n*after* girlie asked me what kind of sauce i wanted with my nuggets, she didn't include any sauce in the bag.  not only that, but there were no fries in that bag either.\n\nso i have to get out of my warm little car and go through the snow storm to get my fried money's worth.\n\nwhen i get inside, they seem frazzled.  i know people have bad days, and i know mistakes happen, but...\n\ni let the girl at the counter know this issue.  she says they're making fries and they'll be done in a moment.  i wait.  fries come up.  what does she do?\n\n...she gives the first order of fries to the guys who came in after me.\n\nnice.\n\napologetically, another employee gives me some fries and i ask for sauce and i'm out the door.  kudos to the other employee that helped a sista get her fat ass on.  however, no kudos to the first girl who apparently thought i was invisible.\n\nas i get in my car and open my nuggets, already out on the street, i realize they didn't give me all the nuggets.  i'm one short.\n\nso let's tally up the fun frenzied fanatics.  (mmmm..alliteration).  no fries.  no sauce (after they asked me what kind) and not all my nuggets.\n\nnope.  no more scottish food for me."}
{"text":"I know nobody goes in here expecting great thing. On this visit, the food was that same as always, the service was what you usually get at fast food places .This is entirely based on how filthy the restaurant was. \n\nkeep in mind I didn't venture in to the restrooms or the dining area. The following is entirely based on just standing in line to order and getting a drink. \n\nThe store was disgusting. Everywhere. The floor was sticky, the counter was sticky, the drink station was covered with spilled pop and straw papers, there was ketchup all over the counter. I think most worrisome, was the state of behind the counter. There were bottles of shake syrup sitting in the middle of the floor which the staff had to keep stepping over, that machine itself was covered in syrup and Oreo crumbs form the dispenser above., there was some red liquid spilled in refrigerated, the floor by the drive thru window was covered in spilled pop which no one cleaned up, and there was what looked to be a whole basket of fries slipped by the fried warmer that no one cleaned up and everyone was just trampling over them.  This is what I could see form the counter. If I could see all this I am not at all hopeful that the back were  the food is cooked is any better, and that is enough for me not to return to this store."}
{"text":"Charming family-owned restaurant that only uses fresh, local products...ah, just kidding. It's a McDonald's. It's in your hometown, it's in my hometown, you can't sneeze in the continental U.S. without hitting a McDonald's. You know what you're getting. I won't lie -- if (I guess I should say \"when\") I'm hungover on Friday or whatnot, I'll pick up a cheap-ass iced coffee that's so big it could drown a marmot."}

{"text":"We all know what type of food you get here, so I'm commenting on the service experience only.  There typically is always a line because of it's central location.  The service is slow at best.  Sometimes I wonder if they are killing the cow for my burger as I order it.  One time while waiting at the 2nd window in drive-thru I watched a girl that worked there reach in the bag of food for someone, take out a french fry and EAT IT!"}
{"text":"Maybe 5 stars is too many, but this place doesn't get enough credit. Say what you will about restaurants in Cleveland (though this still Lakewood, so whatever), but it's service is good, mangers are friendly, and the workers always seem to do a great job. It's aged like any McDonald's would over time, but they're doing right (unlike that Detroit location). Grrrr. I'm lovin' it."}
{"text":"Don't go when they have the guy taking orders on the drive thru with the I pad. It sucks to order with out a menu."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try n sample the secret menu n gotta say ozzy really helped out. Even though they arent able to make it you can order things seperately. The taste to this mccrepe and land air sea burger is da best thing from mcdonalds. Love the service at this location cooked on point."}
{"text":"Why does it take 10 minutes to get 1 combo meal? This place needs an overhaul. There's no organization whatsoever."}
{"text":"This place is average at best.  They screw your order up about 50% of the time.  When they don't screw your order up something is broke or they are out of something.  I only blame myself for going back.  It is the closest place to my house."}
{"text":"By far the worst McDonald's ever! You can never go here and get your order made right! We go to this one because it's 5 minutes from the house but I'm officially boycotting it. Del Taco across the street is what it'll have to be on lazy days I don't feel like cooking for the kids."}
{"text":"This McDonalds. We hate going to this one because no matter what time of the day we go, they always mess up our orders. We have a big family, and every time, there are a few things always missing."}
{"text":"Order was missing items, food was under cooked, seemed like a lot of caos with only 2 customers in line. This place needs a visit by the health department and a lot of retraining for the staff."}
{"text":"Went here after going to a local bar Distill, got to the drive thru and they prompted us to head to the last window to place our order. We waited in the drive thru behind a car for about 5mins, figured the car ordered enough food for a football team. Awkwardly, the car drove off without being handed any food, so we pulled up to the window and couldn't even get anyone's attention to order. Mind you, the window was wide open and I could see workers in there. I tried to get someone's attention and failed as they kept walking pass the Window like idiots. Please don't have ghetto ass people working in a upscale area."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is. I even talked to the manager. But this McD's is by far the worst. Their buns are always hard, dry and cold. Service is slow. Drive-thru personnel never smile or say thank you and 80% of the time they get your order wrong. So check before driving off.  We drive to Blue Diamind location when we want McD's!  Theirs is hot and buns are fresh and better fries.  Worth the drive.  Also, Teenagers always loitering around. Dirty.  Wish a decent hamburger joint would come to So Highlands!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for dessert. We ordered sundaes and asked that they wait to make them until we got to the window since its 104 degrees outside and we didn't want it to melt by the time we got to the window. They did wait as we asked and the sundaes were delicious. We didn't have to wait long in the drive thru line either."}
{"text":"If you are looking to get sick you found that right place!  The food is horrible!  Low quality and bad service!"}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if I could. The overnight staff is rude for no reason. Attitudes and slow service. The food was decent for what it is, but the service makes it not worth it."}
{"text":"Checking out the drive thur after reading all the 1 star reviews......let's see how they do.......everything is in the bag, fresh hot fries even!! Will check the rest of the food once we get home.........and FAIL!!!!! The Chicken Bacon Ranch Hot & spicy was missing both the bacon & the ranch!!!! Ordered 4 cheeseburgers, all 4 were old and cold as well as the 6 piece chicken nuggets...old and cold.  Way to Mc Ds, keeping up with the 1 star reviews."}
{"text":"Drive thru sucks graveyard shift! Waited along time and poor service. Double check your order when going here. Its sucks!"}
{"text":"This is just a standard Vegas 24hr McDonald's which is attached to a Chevron that is the closest one to where I live. Always relatively clean and trash is taken out when I'm here. Breakfast, lunch and graveyard menu are up to standard which I'd expect from a $4-8 menu (ordering fries, spicy McChicken and McDoubles from the dollar menu and McNuggets). I finally had those Mighty Wings and they were pretty large and tasty!"}

{"text":"How does one go about writing a review for McDonalds?  They are everywhere!  So I've prepared a brief thank you letter for Ronald and the gang.  \n\nDear McDonald's Restaurants,  \n\nThank you for having a value menu.  I appreciate that I can order not one but two hamburgers, french fries, and cherry pies for about $4.  Thank you for saving me some money on the days where I only have a few bucks in my wallet.  Thank you inventing the covenanted sausage McMuffin with egg.  You truly are a delicious treat in the morning when I need to put something in my belly to start my day.  Thank you for making your hash browns, a hand held oval replica of you famous french fries.  Thank you for inventing a rib sandwich that only resembles a cartoon version of ribs.  Your tangy bar b que sauce, and the sparse toppings of onions wrapped up in your sesame seed bun is always a treat as you make your appearance for a few weeks each year.  Thank you for being available 24 hours to present your inexpensive delights to me at all hours of the night.  You never disappoint with my low expectations when I dine at you restaurants in Las Vegas and around the world.   \n\nSincerely, \n\nErnesto R.  \n\nCheers!"}
{"text":"Went inside, took 9 mins for someone to greet me. I asked to manager of i should go thru for it to be faster... She replied \"yep.\" I said that is not convenient for the guest. She said \"haha just playing.\"10 mins later I still am at the counter with no food. I am the only person here."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst night shift McDonald's ever!!!\n\nTheir drive through service is horrendous! When you approach the drive through you wait I would say at least 5 mins before someone acknowledges you from the speaker menu.\n\nTonight when I went to the first window to pay no one was there! The car in front of me already left leaving me to wonder if I needed to pull up to the 2nd window instead.  I pull up to the 2nd window only to have a staff member lecture me about not paying. Which by the way I already had my money out ready to pay but because it was an inconvenience for her to walk back to the first window she felt the need to argue first. \n\nTo top things off they had the wrong order so I had to wait again for my order.  Believe it or not it took me about 20 mins for a 10 piece nugget meal! \n\nI thought its called fast food!"}
{"text":"If it was possible to give zero stars I would. The employees on shift this morning were unbelievably rude. The only exception was the gentleman collecting money at the first window who was quite polite and quick with his service. When we got to the next window to pick up our food the woman at that window (she looked like a manager) was incredibly rude and disrespectful. We ordered an egg mcmuffin, 2 hash browns, and 2 yogurt parfaits. We had already paid for our order at the first window so it was confusing when we got to this woman at the second window who rudely informed us that they were out of parfaits. Instead of apologizing and promptly offering us a refund she says nothing. We asked why we were charged if they knew they were out to which she replies \" do you want a refund then or do u want something else\" as if we were seriously inconveniencing her. ???????? At this point I don't care that they don't have a parfait. This is the third unpleasant encounter we have had with this employee and her attitude towards guests is completely unacceptable. She returns a few minutes later to the window shoves the refund and bag of food out the window towards my husband without so much as an apology or anything resembling decent customer service, mumbles have a good day and turns her back to the window. My Sandwich was cold and both hash browns are stuffed into one paper sleeve and both are also cold. I am very disappointed with this location's food quality which is usually below average, but more than anything the way the employees treat the customer every time I have been here (and especially this woman) has ensured that I will avoid this location at all costs. Extremely disappointing. I really hope that the general manager or owners will really take a look at the employees. They should be embarrassed."}
{"text":"They always have maintenence whenever I go. I would rate 0 stars if I could, gives me a good reason not to eat McDonald's anymore."}
{"text":"Food and drinks for cheapskates. (You get what you pay for) Expect them to get your order wrong. Employees have no idea what they're doing half the time."}
{"text":"Probably the worst McDonalds in Las Vegas. They can never get your order correct. So either your burger will be made wrong, or will be missing from your bag completely once you get home!"}
{"text":"Every time I go their ice cream machine is down. It's a hang out for all the kids in the neighborhood. This establishment including terribles chevron connected to it, does not seem to care what goes on in or around their business. Low class for the area they are in."}
{"text":"The worst McDonald's in the world.\n\nPulled up to the drive thru. No one at the first window. Pulled up behind a car at the second window and someone from the first window sticks his head out and shouts, \"First window please.\" I said well no one was there. He said, \"I've been here this whole time\" and proceeded to argue with me about how he never left the window.\n\nDidn't even bother talking to the manager because she was laughing at the way he talked to me.\n\nApparently they hire from the streets because this dimwit had no sense of customer service or communication. If I could give negative stars I would."}
{"text":"They forgot my order and would not refund my money when I called. Then I went online to fill out the survey and it said someone would contact me and nobody has. Really bad device even for a crapy McD's"}
{"text":"Believe the reviews! To say that the service is consistently inconsistent is putting it mildly. It's so unfortunate too because I can literally walk to this location from my house! We ordered and got to the window to pay and the manager was \"hanging out\" with the cashier telling him a personal story that I could hear as a passenger in the car in the drive thru. We proceed to pull up to the next window and the girl asks us what we ordered and we had to repeat it to her 3 times. She hands us the the 2 McFlurries with ice cream dripping all over the outside of the lids and cups, the sundae has hot fudge pouring out around the lid and its dripping all over my pants, and she hands us everything one by one with no carrier, doesn't give us any straws (which is a regular thing at this drive thru) and of course we realize it when we get home. It's clear that their employees don't have the slightest care to service their customers properly and their managers are setting that example for them. A little pride and consideration would be nice to experience from this location at least once in awhile, after all our patronage is paying your hourly wage. Extremely disappointing and I will be contacting their corporate office tomorrow for follow up on my experience."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever encountered at a McDonald's. From the lack of cleanliness to the rude and disinterested employees and the poorly prepared food there is not one reason to recommend this location. There are several other McDonald's within a short distance and all are preferable to this Southern Highlands location."}
{"text":"Worst Mcdonald s ice ever been too \n\nI can walk to this place and keep going back to give them another chance,\nNo more it stinks.\nNothing good to say about anything there."}
{"text":"WORST MCDONALDS EVER!\n\nEvery single time we have been to this McDonalds on Southern Highlands Parkway we ask for our burgers and fries to be made up fresh.  They never are, in fact, they are cold and the buns are cold as well.  Step it up McDonalds!  Your reviews are bad and this is the Manager's fault!"}
{"text":"Growing up eating fast food and then in high school working out and packing burgers and nuggets, weren't enough to exclude the lack of ingenuity and service this McDonald's can provide.  There are some other locations that look much nicer and and have better customer service.  McDonald's been going downhill with my tastebuds.  You can go anywhere else with fast casual gigs or if anything in n out xD"}
{"text":"After hours!!! This place is horrible it's conveniently close to where I live and especially when I get off work. I work in the casinos and don't get off til 2-3 am in the morning. Every time I try to order something they are closed!? Like why have a 24 hour drive thru sign if your closed!? And it's always 3 time a week l get this from one of the workers. And sometime they also say the system is down and they can only take cash I hardly ever have cash on me and it's just a huge convenience for me. If you own this McDonalds and or manager of this spot and is reading this review!! please take down your 24 hour drive thru sign. BECAUSE IT'S NOT!!!!! It's always a waste of my time driving there after work knowing there closed or just take cash only. I have a lot of neighbors that complain about this McDonalds in particular just because of your after house. So please keep this in mind and \"REMOVE YOUR 24 HOUR DRIVE THRU SIGN!!\""}
{"text":"I truly never thought that I would write a review about a McDonalds but I guess I am. I hate to say this but you ALWAYS need to check your bags for your food, this goes with every fast food restaurant. This particular location has done an amazing job at really stepping up their game to ensure that they are getting orders right."}
{"text":"The worst McDonalds I have ever been to.  The really sad thing is that it's been that way ever since it opened.  There's a 50% chance your order will be wrong or cold or both.  80% chance you will wait forever in the drive thru line."}
{"text":"Messed up our meal three times. Simple orders too. No sweet tea available. Non sense!"}
{"text":"Believe the reviews. This place will screw your order up. Having read the reviews before going in the drive thru I paid extra attention to my order and had to correct the lady three times before she got my order right, her broken English did not help either. When I received my order I double checked a few items that I wanted plain, but could not check everything since they piled my order in one bag and I did not want to hold up the line. Sure enough when I got to my destination I found to be missing five dollars worth of my order. How bad  do you have to be to mess up Mc Donalds?"}
{"text":"They were only taking cash and didn't even have a sign up! Crazy how McDonald's is doing this without letting people know. Had to wait in the drive thru for 20 minutes to get out."}
{"text":"Only ordered 4 items: apple pie, bbq Ranch Burger, small fries, and large Mocha frape. Still messed up my order. Made me wait because they ran out of Mocha mix. Gave me medium frap, no apple pie. Went inside told them I ordered large and the missing apple pie. They said there were no apple pies left. Made me wait more than 10 min. And incorrect order. Just left and disregarded the pie out of my frustration. So bad"}
{"text":"I never thought I would write a review of a McDonalds, much less have to write a negative review for a McDonald's. I don't even know how it's possible that a McDonald's could be so bad but unfortunately this one is.   \n\nLike many people, I have eaten at McDonalds all over America and even in several other countries.  I have to say this is probably one of the worst McDonald's I've ever been to other than the one in Manila in the Philippines -and that's only because I'm not sure that what was in those burgers was even beef.\n\nWhere do I begin? The service is terrible. I have never, not ONE time, gotten what I ordered. I get sweet tea when I ask for unsweetened. I get cheese when I ask for none. I get onions when I ask for none. I get 2 chicken sandwiches when I ask for 4 apple pies.  I have given up on going through the drive thru because I always end up having to pull around, park, go in and wait in the long line of teenagers getting shakes  just to get them to correct my order. And even then, they don't get it right and I actually have to tell them, \"No see, this is a Chicken Sandwich, I ordered a McDouble.\"\n\nThe food is almost always cold. The burgers are dry and taste like they have been sitting on a shelf for more than an hour. And the fry's..ugh! When there are 6 cars in the drive thru and 20 people in line, I just don't understand how the fry's can be cold and stale. It absolutely defies logic. \n\nYes, there are times that the food comes out hot. It's one of the reasons I keep going back. There's nothing like hot Fry's from McDonalds.. and also, just because it's McDonald's. Like it or not, it's a staple for working parents too tired to cook dinner after work some nights. It is unfortunate that they have no competition in the immediate area to keep them on their toes, otherwise they might actually try to improve their service and their product. I am sure they are turning a profit. No doubt. It seems to always be busy. However, I truly believe that if ANY other burger joint opened up right next door, this place would close down in a month. Every time I say I'm never going back, I still do. Unfortunately, tonight will be one of those nights as the kids specifically requested it. The shear dread of what I'm about to go through is what prompted this review.  \n\nI really hope they improve. It hurts to have to knock a McDonald's."}
{"text":"only reason i rated 5 stars was so everyone can see this comment \n\nthis is the worst mcdonalds location ever do not go here the workers are rude disrespectful and unperfessional\n(heads up they only sell mcgridels at 4 am)\nand please don't go here. they r disrespectful \nkill them with kindness !!!!!!!!!!!\n\ni am so livid over this stupid mcdonalds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is so bad. Orders are wrong more then they ate correct. I once seen a dog on the counter. Management did nothing . I don't think they use coke product. It is horrible tasting. I believe is a cols of some kind not coke."}
{"text":"I never believed it until now,..  \"they screw you at the drive thru\"...  Yep. Check your bag before you leave the window because they have a tendency more often than not to not give you what you ordered.\n\nCase in point:  Today at 5:45am, picking up breakfast for the family.  Purchased 4 hash browns, 2 sausage burritos, 1 parfait, 2 large sweet teas and a hotcakes and sausage with extra butter (and I asked for the extra butter repeatedly).  We waited the drive thru for a good 5 minutes because they were making our hash browns \"fresh\", so they said.  \n\nI get home, and there is no parfait.  ERGH!!!  Called the restaurant and it seems like them screwing up at the drive thru is common place.  She took my name down and asked if I wanted to come back this morning, or if she should add my name to the book.  \n\nNow that one of my kids did not have their breakfast item, I continued to go through the bags to find out that there is NO extra butter, and they didn't include the picante sauce packets for the burritos.  \n\nHow hard is it for your employees to double check the bags before you give it to the customer?  I mean, you have the receipt that tells you exactly what to put in the bags.  \n\nThis is the closest Mc Donald's to our home, and it will soon be put on my banned restaurant list."}
{"text":"Several Times I have Visited this Location, and I Have Encountered...Messed Up Orders, The Drive Thru Order Takers are Not Very Friendly, and at times The Order Takers inside don't pay attention to Customers Standing Right in Front of their Counters until, the Manager Says something!\n\nHonestly, This Particular Location can be a Hit-or-Miss! One Day you'll get Excellent Customer Service, the Next Day Not So Much!"}
{"text":"I can see why this location has such a low rating. I saw a posting on the overhead menu that there were some sandwiches on sale for 2 for 5. . I proceeded to order 2 big macs and was told the sale doesn't start until the 26th. I believe it was the shift lead or manager wearing a blue uniform was the cashier taking my order. When I asked why was it already posted without a start date all she said was ummm ummm and couldn't give me a straight answer. I told her that having it posted is false advertising. She just looked at me , shrugged her shoulders and said oh wells, good bye. I have been a customer here since it first open. Because of her bad attitude and service , my family will go elsewhere and I will also report this to upper management and to corporate office."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!! NOTORIOUS FOR PLACING WRONG ORDERS AND NOW a new policy has been added by the change from CORPORATE to NOT reimburse for THEIR Errors. This place needs to permanently closed or change over ownership. Stealing people's hard earn money is not good business practice. If you are prepared to do that to your customer imagine how they treat the feeding of the customer. WHAT A FAILED BUSINESS OUTFIT. When Mcdonalds is already on the cusp of going out of business for selling chemicals in place of food, causing obesity and an unwillingness to pay its employees enough an hour to even afford one of those 'meals' on their menus. We need to advocate in our beautiful community for healthier fast food options and perhaps smaller mom and pop outfits that recognizes the value of each customer. Without us getting fat eating that crap MCDONALD'S WOULD BE OUT OF BUSINESS!!! P.s. Take a look at the other Mcdonalds in the area, it's fast food but at least they score a 3 1/2 stars.   If I could give zero stars I would for the handling by the day manager that didn't even know how much the meals cost or the amount of tax needed for the transaction with out punching a button. I feel horrible for the night manager that said he got 'written up' for attempting to do the right thing. What a fail. Should make your stomach sick to eat here."}
{"text":"I order a simple plain cheeseburger. This establishment's workers messed it up. Expected!!! I return the burger and waited for my new one. This time, it WAS plain BUT they lazily slap on some ice cold cheese on the burger. They didn't take 5 seconds to make my order correctly. Needless to say, I won't be coming back here anytime soon. Poor Service!"}
{"text":"Only place I can get fed this late around here and BigMac never gets old!!!! :)"}
{"text":"While I don't expect much service from McD's, this place really annoyed me recently.  We ordered two iced coffees and when we received them, they were as white as milk.  It looked like there was no coffee in them or an over pour of milk. So I asked the cashier nicely and said \"is it possible to get less milk in these?\" Her response was \"that's the way we make them\". Sorry, but I've never seen McD's iced coffee that white before.   \n\nI don't understand.  What if someone wanted their iced coffee black?  Do you still pour milk in it? Anyways, when we got them back, they were still quite white but I just said \"whatever at that point\". There was absolutely no coffee taste to it.  \n\nMaybe the owner/manager here is trying to pull a fast one over on customers or it was just an innocent mistake by the staff, but I'm still annoyed by \"that's the way we make it comment\". It's not like I asked for more. I asked for LESS milk. I could care less if it's not as filled, but I just want the coffee and milk ratio to be adequate.  \n\nNever dropping by this McD's again. Terrible."}
{"text":"Very slow service, also the store was cold with the drive door open. Food wait was 20 mins but at least it was hot, thats why i give it a 1"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of McDonald's but you usually cannot go wrong with th√™ bacon egg and cheese biscuit so that is what I got. Th√™ to the long drive thru line u decided to go inside. There was only person ahead of me inside but it took longer than the 5 cars in the drive thru!! Tip: probably best to stay in your car as the drive thru seems to get priority."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this location zero stars. We just had the rudest experience here. The asshole taking our order could've be bothered with our order. Like it wasn't his job. Will actively attempt to avoid this location because of this experience."}
{"text":"I can go years without visiting a McDonalds.  Every once in a while though, I get an undeniable urge for a Big Mac.  Today was just such a day.  I rarely review fast food and/or chain restaurants unless they are exceptional.  This one was. \n\nIt was after 1:00 and I had to run out, wolf down some lunch and get back for a 2:00 conference call.  I decided to visit this location on S. Tryon, near I-77, Woodlawn and Billy Graham Parkway.  The place was bulldozed a couple years ago and rebuilt as a new, modern McDonalds.  Unfortunately, it still suffers the same old flaw of incompetent staff and management.\n\nI decided to dine in... and I thought this was a good idea because the drive-thru was backed up.  I found the last open parking spot on the side of the building where the door is, and went inside.  The counter has three cash registers, and as I queue up in line I realize that only one register is in use.  At lunch time.  On a main city street, at the intersection with an interstate freeway and a parkway!\n\nAs I stood watching in disbelief, the cashier would take one order, go make the milkshakes and ice cream, stuff food in the bags, deliver the food, then take the next order.  One person, one customer, one order at a time.  \"Next?  Can I take your order?\"\n\nThe drive thru was running on its own, there were several people in the back preparing food, one mopping, and a couple more doing maintenance in the dining room.  The person who is seemed to be the manager was having a casual conversation with the cooks about how to say \"napkin\" in Spanish.  Apparently the answer to that questions is, \"servietta.\"\n\nOh yeah...  and the one person on the one register?  Her cell phone rings, and of course, she has to answer it.  So she has a cell phone plastered to one ear while she has her full customer service energies focused where?  On whoever it is she's talking to on the phone.\n\nEventually the manager finishes \"shooting the shit\" with the kitchen staff, restocking serviettas, etc. and comes over to open a second register... and with this, the original girl goes out on break.  At least the manager has the sense to take a whopping THREE orders in a row.  I guess this limited sense of initiative is why they made her the manager.\n\nWhen I finally get my food (no \"please\", \"thank you\", \"sorry for your wait\", or any other common courtesies) it has taken so long I no longer have time to eat.  I have to rush back to my office for the conference call, and of course by the time I get there, my fries are cold.  I can't eat cold fries.\n\nNo wonder I can go years without going to a McDonalds..."}
{"text":"On a busy stretch of one of the main surface streets into Uptown Charlotte, this McDonald's gets a good amount of drive through business. I stopped in on the way home after an errand and instead of the drive through, I opted to go inside.\n\nQuite busy and one of the crew was busy cleaning the counter. After that, she needed to spend some time on the floor, which had a penny and two straw wrappers. The drinks and condiments area was clean and well stocked.\n\nNot the fastest McD's around, but they get the job done."}
{"text":"Laziest group of ingrates I have ever come across!! Not even worth $5.15 min wage when I started working in 2000, enjoy your welfare!!!! I wouldn't want to give a star but that wasn't an option"}
{"text":"I've had a very positive experience with this McDonalds. Unfortunately for my health the job Im doing now requires me to eat something very quick and on the go. I go to this Mickey ds every day to pick up lunch and everytime I go my food is hot and quick. Also the service is always super friendly! Would recommend to all."}
{"text":"Slow service and could not get a receipt. How does an entire store run out of receipt paper?"}
{"text":"Terrible.\n\nIt's really hot in there if it's humid and not very welcoming because of it.  \n\nThey messed up my breakfast order on drive-thru more than once, but what can you do when you're in a hurry to get some grub in da belly before you start a long day of work.\n\nI've been to many McD's that are better than this spot and would highly recommend the Subway which is pretty close or even just buying food at the gas station that is next door to it.  \n\ndmo out."}
{"text":"I pick up lunch from this location once in a while, since there isn't a whole lot to choose from close to my work. This place is packed from 11am- 1pm. The staff is ok... slow but ok. The one thing I have to comment on is that I hate the new automatic response on the drive through. \n\n\"Hi, Welcome to McDonald's. Would you like to try our hot chocolate today?\" \n\nThen there is a pause... and you get a real person. \n\n\"Hi, can I take your order?\"\n\nUm... No I don't want a hot chocolate... it's July! Why would I want a hot chocolate? \n\nOh... and if you place your order at the first drive through order box, and you pull up to the second one, because you're behind someone you'll go through the same ordeal all over again and then you'll have to explain to the lady on the other end that you've already placed your order.\n\nThat's the price you pay for going to McDonalds.. a headache."}
{"text":"Everything we got was burnt and took over 15 min to get (we were the only ones in the drive thru)"}
{"text":"It is currently 12:35am and I am staying at the Motel 6 next door. I walked over to McDonald's. The door says they close at 1:00am. The door is locked. I knock on the door. A tall black guy looks out from the counter and does the it's over sign to me. I hold up 1 finger and then point to the door because it says closed at 1am. The black guy who I am assuming is the manager just shrugs his shoulders. Now him and another employee start laughing. Owner needs to do something about their employees fast losing money and business everyday I'm sure."}
{"text":"In the time it takes to go through this drive through, I could slaughter a chicken, de-feather it, butcher it, and grill it...then have time to pick lettuce leaves to make my own grilled chicken salad. \n\nBottom Line: The drive through is notoriously slow.  So slow, my co-workers and I sometimes go to Wendy's for our fast food fix.  \n\nThe people can be nice...others sort of out of it.  \n\nTIP: Check the bag before you drive away from the window.  Chances are you won't have the right dressing, a straw, or something is incorrect."}
{"text":"Worst McDonalds ever.  Ordered a sundae, milk shake, small fry and medium Coke.  The guy taking the order said the ice cream machine was broken and left us hanging on the rest of the order, so I pulled around to the window.  Asked him about the rest of the order and he said he didn't hear me.  I asked about the ice cream machine and he said they never clean it.  \nThe wait was terribly long and once I got to the window the manager never apologized for anything.  Poor customer service at its highest.  Food was actually OK."}
{"text":"Literally the worst drive thru on the face of this green Earth. Waited for more than 15 minutes in the queue to get two cups of coffee. Not sure if it's a staffing problem or just bad logistics but this location always fails to deliver."}
{"text":"People, it's mcdonalds!\nThis location has been around for years!! I remember coming here for birthday parties as a child.\nI know at least 5 people who have worked here previously throughout the years.\n\nThe restaurant was renovated a few years ago so it is up to date. The play place is quite nice for the kids considering 8-10 years ago they had stand up video games instead of climbers... 0_o\nThe bathrooms are small and could be better.\nThere is tons of seating, but like others have mentioned, there's usually a lot of people 'hanging out'.\n\nThe drive thru is weirdly positioned as you have to wait for a break in traffic driving through the parking lot to pull up to the window after you've ordered. And be careful making that turn after getting your food.\n\nThis location is not fast at all... usually backed up at both the driveway and inside.\nThe employees do try though.\nMy order is only sometimes wrong.\nYes the food isn't the healthiest but if you are going to eat at Mcdonalds, than you already know that.\n\nThe fact that other yelpers think this location is the \"ghetto\" is hilarious. Yes it's a low income area but I can name 3 other parts of Mississauga that are waaaaay more \"ghetto\".\n\n3.5/5\nI love me some greasy food"}
{"text":"We all know McDonalds. I don't have much to add about the chain or the food. Although, the value meal burger did suck... \n\nQuick facts about this particular location: \n\n1. Fairly busy on weekday evenings\n2. Has a play area for kids\n3. Convenient location on Lakeshore Mississauga, next to a Dollarama in a strip mall\n4. Order-taker forgot my mayonnaise\n\nThat's it, folks!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the best and most friendly/cool McDonalds I've ever been to. I love them there, EXCEPT... they don't have orange drink/pop/fruitopia. This is a problem."}

{"text":"Not a very convenient drive-thru.  Big location, free wifi.\nJust located in a semi-ghetto area.\nLarge dining area."}
{"text":"I don't know they put Mcdonald's in yelp. Most of people already known that this place is the popular place. If you compare the food quality they are the same just the place is different. Overall i voted 2 stars cuz most of the food there are so unhealthy"}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's in town.\n\nI went to the bathroom, and a staff member was waiting / standing in front with a mop. I asked her: Can I enter the washroom, is it clean? And she said Yes. I entered, and there was an overflowed toilet and the floor was covered in brown water. How on earth did the staff member think the bathroom was clean to use? Why on earth was she just standing outside the door and waiting. \n\nNEVER COMING HERE AGAIN. GROSS. Somebody call the health inspector."}
{"text":"This is probably the most ghetto McDonald's in Mississauga - and that's saying something.\n\nThe location at Lakeshore and Cawthra has been a staple of the Lakeview area for a very long time, and despite its modernization in recent years, it still retains an aura of scuzziness and a cheap feeling. Sure, there are other locations in other areas that can be matched for the lazy feeling of their design (see some of the locations in Etobicoke or Brampton), but this one gets such a low score precisely because of its patrons.\n\nGo on any average day, and you're bound to find lineups, servers who screw up your order half the time (which is par for the course, admittedly), drunken patrons demanding coffee refills or a fix to their order and screaming kids running around the out-of-date playground. Yes, it has a large dining area, but your choice of seating will be limited most of the time, and it's hard to shake the permeating smell of diapers that seems to linger near the front door.\n\nOn one hand, I feel somewhat bad for the staff. Stuck in an undesirable location that's seen as the cheapest fast food option by far within 20 blocks, but on the other, I had a friend who worked there and told me all about the terrible working conditions, useless manager(s) and the overall mediocre food.\n\nThe only reason you'd come here is if you're desperate or really cheap. There are a half-dozen better options in the immediate area (including an Osmow's and a Subway, both of which are less than a 30 second walk away) that provide much better food and service for the price."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for zero stars. They never cook the fries done enough (crispy like other McD's). Never have enough staff. Always have a drive through back up. Employees are slow as snails. They tried to get my order right twice and didn't, I asked for a refund--they couldn't give me one so I just left the food. That's how bad the service is."}
{"text":"I can't agree with the previous reviews that this is the worst McDonald's ever but it certainly is far from the best. My order is frequently wrong. But the food is hot. I have never been inside and I don't really plan on it."}
{"text":"Yep.  A review of McDonald's.  I seem to be writing up fast food joints lately.  I guess because I feel it is needed or something.\n\nIn this case, the Mickey D's is around the corner from our house, which means that we've been there before.  Okay, we've been there a lot.  I'll admit it.\n\nThey used to be pretty decent, when McDonald's would make the food and let it sit - and yes, I know that means that I'm telling everyone how old I am by admitting that I remember that time.\n\nNow that the food is made when you order it, it's pretty bad.  Typically, you have to wait.  And wait.  And wait.  The service typically isn't very good, which is to be expected for fast food, but it's even worse here, and it's not getting any better.\n\nThe other day I was surprised to see a manager working the front counter, and amazingly, food was going out faster than ever.  Maybe things were turning around?  Within perhaps 30 seconds of ordering I had my order.  A sign of things to come?\n\nNope.  Wrong food in the bag.  At least he tried.  Sigh...\n\nSweet Tea Report:  McDonald's has recently been getting into the \"Southern Style\" Fast-Food, presumably to compete with Chick-Fil-A.  They have a Southern Style Chicken Sandwich, they have sweet tea, the only problem is that they don't do it as well.  Their sweet tea isn't bad though.  I would actually say that it is almost better than Chick-Fil-A if it was consistent.    But it comes up different almost every time - and getting refills can be difficult at certain locations.  Some are on a beverage bar, while others you have to go to the counter, making it more challenging.  Otherwise, they do have promise."}
{"text":"Literally the worst McDonald's ever, and that's horrific to say. Literal garbage, the employees suck almost as much as the shitty food. I'd rather die than come back. We got half our order and were told they can't fix it. Absolute laziness. Will never return."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst MD's I've personally experienced because it's so unorganized although I can tell they've tried being organized and it didn't work..The line is ridiculously long like almost any time of the day and especially mornings...so that's not helping...second they have a lot of employees at a small location like this....they tried making a mini island to make coffee but its weird that the food comes much faster than the coffee so what does that tell you? The setup is not working....and change it asap! I hope someone actually working there will read reviews..=P\n\nPrime location is definitely the reason why they are extremely busy...They don't even put any lettuce in my burger anymore...is that a norm? or I just don't eat mickey D's enuf...I have no clue..\n\n\nNo choice only when I crave for MD's"}
{"text":"So the Minion toys are out @ McDonalds causing a frenzy!!!!!\nI have about 20 unopened happy meal toys that I have been saving up & waiting patiently for the Minions to swap them.\nI've always been told if my child did not like the toys I could swap them later if they were unopened.\nI have had success swapping the toys @ 2 other locations in Toronto.\nToday I tried to swap @ this location & they would not allow me too because the Minions are SO popular.\nI found this unacceptable! One cashier was going to do the swap for me & another cashier spoke up, they went to the manager Naseem & she wouldn't either.\nSo poor service from my part from a loyal customer. I stood in line for 20 mins to do the swap. Disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The line can be fairly long most of the time but there's always a number of staff working and they'll get you through quickly."}
{"text":"Once again, I don't usually review fast food places but this McDonalds should be well known for the staff, because their drive through times are absolutely insane. I had a time around midnight where I was absolutely starving so I decided to go grab some food. It took them less than 2 minutes to cook wverything up but needless to say, it was all still pretty good! Mornings are pretty amazing too. Despite the fact that it is absolutely busy, the drive through times are absolutely insane."}
{"text":"Poor service at night... Customer service wasn't as good as what I'm use to at other mcd's"}
{"text":"So i go here every morning for a fruit and fibre muffin and a coffee. Here is the deal, a muffin cost's 10 cents if you get the coffee. Great muffins and an ice coffee ( i get it with milk, no cream) is $1.00 during the summer. FUCK WHAT YAH HURD!"}
{"text":"Long days of studying and reading requires quick, delicious food filled with calories. During my all-nighters, McDonalds is the place to visit. The burgers and fries are tasty and provide a satisfying dinner. During my previous visit, I ordered the Big Mac Combo with fries and Coffee. The burger was average and the meat was decent for fast food. The service is expectedly average and the d√©cor is the same with every McDonalds restaurant. Overall, this location met my expectations of a McDonalds restaurant. I recommend this to everyone who wants fast and tasty food."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. And apparently all the employees have a hard time hearing. I asked for my burger without PICKLES or mustard. But I guess the girl heard no onions or mustard. So I brought it back up and I'm going to assume I talked to the shift manager and she said \"well it says no onions that's why you didn't get onions\". Obviously that's why I didn't get onions. I'm not stupid. But that's not what I had said. \nI guess pickles and onions sound the same. \n\nThis location sucks only because the employees are not friendly and they don't listen. Your job isn't that hard. And if you hate it then do something about it. Don't give someone crappy service because of it."}
{"text":"This is a newer McDonald's, which is designed with a more contemporary feel. There's a large indoor playground for your kids too. Service was quite sluggish though.\n\nDespite the wait, this will be forever in my memory be the first McDonald's where I tried a shamrock shake (Minty creamy sweet delicious!)."}
{"text":"I have used this Micky D's a few times in the past and it was OK. Today we were just using the drive through to pick up a kid's meal for my grandson. They need a new order-taking speaker. The sound was really garbled. The drive-through is poorly designed, so that only one car can be in the lane waiting to use the speaker and place an order. Today the line of cars snaked into the main parking lot, blocking the flow of traffic for all businesses in this shopping center.\nThe food was ready pretty quick, but my grandson only ate about half of it because \"it doesn't taste very good.\"\nWhat can I add to this observation of a 7 year old child?"}
{"text":"This McDonald's is okay. I've been to better ones. \n\nMy friends and I stopped here for breakfast en route to the NASCAR race. We had to wait a few minutes for their food, which was no big deal, so my friend and I found a table while our other friend used the bathroom. When she came back to the table, the look on her face said it all. She informed us NOT to use the bathroom there unless we use the handicap stall. Why? Because some female had started her monthly problem and left evidence of it IN PLAIN SIGHT on top of the disposal receptacle inside the stall plus the toilet was a mess! The bathroom in general looked as if it hadn't been checked or cleaned in quite some time as well, our friend said. \n\nI'm sorry, but any place that doesn't take the time to clean up all parts of their place of business won't be getting my business ever again!"}
{"text":"The past few times I have stopped at this restaurant to use the drive thru; its been backed up to at least 9 cars.  This McDonalds had customers all confused of who was next in line, which unfortunately there was customers trying to cut in from another side of the drive thru. BUT still if McDonalds was having a order that was taking longer then usual, then ask the customers nicely to park to the side so you can move the other cars waiting.  I thought maybe the whole Restaurant was behind but someone parked and went inside to get their food, to come out only 2 minutes later.  Unfortunately I could not do that since I was caught in the middle of the line.  That indicated to me that they were not behind through the whole store, it was just the drive thru that was sucking.  I like this McDonalds, but they need to be aware of their customers outside also. Its unpleasant when you have to deal with other customers trying to act like they been in line the whole time and trying to cut in from a different side of the McDonalds.  Very rude.  Its common knowledge that the mornings and lunch hours are the busiest, put in better procedures or processes to make sure the customer is happy."}
{"text":"I vow to never step foot into this mcdonald's again.  It is by far, the nastiest McDonald's I have ever visited.  \n\nWe went in today for an after school mcflurry.  The place smelled bad (think vomit) and it was dirty.  The upholstered chairs are in such bad shape that they have been \"repaired\" with duct tape all along the entire bank of tables.  \n\nThis place gives me the creeps.  So long McDonald's.  I don't think I'll miss you."}
{"text":"Please note: I realize this is fast food and I am rating it as such.\n\nThis is what I ordered in the drive-thru and in this order:  1 chocolate milk, 1 small orange juice, 1 large vanilla iced coffee, 6 sausage mcmuffins, 1 large coke.  \nHere is the response I got:  1 large french vanilla iced coffee, anything else?\n\nIt took a few tries but she finally got my order right.  When we picked up the food, the coffee had no flavoring.  Albeit, I was mad at the need to go into the restaurant (we used drive-thru for a reason) but when I got in there the manager said she didn't give me flavoring because of how they wrote the ticket.  She was wearing the drive-thru headset!  When I asked who took my order then, she flat out lied to me and said someone else took it.  It's one thing to get crappy service in a fast food restaurant but when the manager has no honesty or integrity at all, they deserve to go out of business.  I really hope the manager above her sees this.  If a manager can't even be honest to a customer about a simple order, what else is she capable of doing?"}
{"text":"I am amped that this particular site does not include four dipping sauces for a 20 piece, Chicken McNuggets. The only give 3, and you have to pay for the fourth. Any other McDonald's in the area gives you four without asking. This McDonald's is trying to pull a fast one. So I just want everyone to know how dirty I think this is.\n Ever since I was a kid when we ordered nuggets we got 4 dipping sauces. That 5 nuggets per sauce. They expect me to try and ration almost 7 nuggets per container? That's unacceptable. I guess I will visit the McClintock or the ASU locations from now on."}
{"text":"It's McDonald's, expect the expected. This location isn't open late. Keep going down to the one next to AZ Mills for late nite McD's."}
{"text":"Where do I start..\nI came here the first week it opened because I needed breakfast before work and I saw that they were giving away free small coffees for their grand opening.  The next couple of days, we were going religiously to receive our coffee.  The first day, it took a good five minutes to get our coffee.  Giving them the benefit of the doubt, that maybe they were new and the second time would be better.. The second and third time around, was the same thing.  There was even one time we ordered two regular coffees and one with one milk and the girl who was working there was so confused and had to ask us to repeat our order two or three times to get the order right.  We decided to walk-in one day, since the Drive-Thru takes forever, and it was packed!  The restaurant is very modern and clean and has a different layout than any other McDonald's I've been to.  They were taking orders and giving orders left, right and center.  Some guests were waiting two minutes for their food and coffee, others five or ten minutes.  They took forever to give us our coffee that day and they finally figured out the quickest way to get people in and out was to ask the guests for their receipt to get their food and drinks quickly.  The next time we came, we used a Buy One Get One Free coupon.  We ordered a Big Mac and a Quarter Pounder with Cheese (no pickles, onions or mustard) with pickles and onions on the side.  The supervisor that took our order through the Drive-Thru window was so confused as to what we were trying to order.  When we got to the window to pay, he had to re-read the coupon and told us we had to order a combo in order to receive the second sandwich free.  So we told him that the coupon actually states that you have to order a medium or large fries or a side salad.. so we went with medium fries.  Five minutes later waiting at the Drive-Thru, we get our food order and I look inside the bag and there was no extra packets of ketchup, two napkins and no pickles or onions on the side and a random mustard dipping sauce.  Then when we actually get home, I open up my burger to see if they messed up the order, and they ended up putting a piece of a pickle in my burger that looked like it was half eaten, and a blob of ketchup, no bigger than a size of a toonie.  I took the first bite of my burger and it was dry (with their being a blob of ketchup) and the cheese was not even fully melted.  The fries were cold and stale tasting and not filled to the top so we basically paid for a small fries.  I give this McDonalds one star for it's nice ambience but I think I'd rather travel a little further to get my orders right and not have to wait ten minutes each time for my food, being as McDonalds is a FAST-FOOD restaurant."}
{"text":"This McDonald's grand opening is offering free coffee from Sept 22 to Sept 27. Service really needs to improve because they are really slow. Took them 10 minutes to ring in an order for a Quarter Pounder (No Cheese) Combo."}
{"text":"OK seriously what happened to this place? It's so filthy now. Flies everywhere. Dirty tables. Terrible smell. I'm too hesitant to order any food item here."}
{"text":"Newest McDonald's in the area! \n\nLove the newer design. Tons of outlets everywhere to charge up whatever gadgets you have. \n\n3 large TVs, maybe it is not a bad place to watch some LIVE sports.\n\nAnd of course Free Wifi!\n\nWaiting for your numbers to call to pick up your food is not a bad idea and hopefully the system would be faster after their grand opening madness."}
{"text":"Well, usually I wouldn't be reviewing any fast food places. They are a dime a dozen and they pride themselves on crappy food, crappy service, and crappy atmosphere. \n\nThis McDonald's is different though. What I mean is that the service is still crappy, but atmosphere is like all the rest, but the food isn't as bad. No, I don't meant the burgers or the overpriced nuggets, the food that actually tastes ok is their pastry. This location is the only McDonald's that I have been able to find the good pastries. And if you go earlier enough, you can get the pastries that are still hot. Their filling is maple or chocolate, but I always get the maple. It is a lot better than the Timmys and other McDonald's in the area."}
{"text":"Being a new open beside zoup and a st Louis wings, I would expect the service to be faster. There were long waits and the kitchen crew seemed to be confused ad to what they are supposed to do.  I am not sure if this location is targeted for the teen/ uni crowd but they really have the music playing loud and was not able to have a conversation with my friend who was sitting just across without repeating myself numerous times and or yelling!  I am sure this is just the growing pains in their initial opening"}
{"text":"So after a long time of coming here I've realized 2 things. They have more staff now and they can still mess orders ups. Insane how you can still mess orders up at a fast food restaurant when there is a screen that tells you what I've ordered! I'm usually in a rush when this happens so I don't even get a chance to check and go back. Although now I order inside and check right on the spot. Don't know why this happens when I'm in a rush but wow its nuts. I've had wrong size fries and different burger. \n\nWill still probably come back since this Mcd is close to my work places. \n\nJust double check your orders!"}
{"text":"on the way to work offsite in Richmond HIll, this Mikey D's just recently opened.  They usually say Breakfast is the most imporant meal of the day, so this place was my GO-TO! \nthe layout of the place is great, and for the most part is clean. I opted for the multi grain bagel with their BLT, and rather than coffee, I chose to have their strawberry/ banana smoothie.  TBH, MD beat's out Tim's smoothies hands down! It's been a while since I've had their breakfast and based on the experience, glad I made the right decision to come here!"}
{"text":"This is not your typical McDonald's! I walked in and discovered a very different look.  Was I in the right place?\n\nMcDonald's in revealing its new floor plan, in a more compact footprint.  Instead of the long counter, there is a narrow order station, and a separate pickup area.  They are using the number system for better order control.  Even the drive through is not familiar to me--it is \"tandem\" instead of having two lanes clumsily converge into one.\n\nFresh, Euro-orderly, and it has free wifi!  I think it works.  My Big Breakfast Combo was the best I've had at any McD's.  Don't get me wrong-this isn't my beloved 5-star Eggs Benedict at the Grand Hyatt, but is certainly worth 5 stars in comparison with it's segment competition!"}
{"text":"This latest incarnation of a McDonald's looks great inside!  Very modern and slick TV monitors make this place look like a McDonald's from the future.  That is probably all it has going for it though.  The staff and management are so new that they have no idea what they are doing up to this point.\n\nUsually I wouldn't review a McDonald's, but I felt like this one needed it.  They need to train their staff and get things going because just ordering a coffee ended up taking 15-20 minutes.  The staff have no idea what the usual specials are, let alone how to make a coffee with 1 cream and 1 sugar.\n\nAt one point the cashier was so confused when I handed her a $20 bill, that I literally had to scramble to get her exact change as she didn't know what to do with it.  If you're in a rush, this probably is the worst McDonald's you can go to right now.  I'm giving it 2 stars for the monitors and huge TV screens and decent wifi!"}
{"text":"Was there late night studying this past Sunday. Small and cozy branch.  The TVs were playing sports (Stanley cup finals on one, and F1 racing on another). This is perfect for me being a sports fanatic.  I will go there for Euro cup games when I don't feel like drinking at the bar."}
{"text":"Drive through line ups are long, especially during free coffee week. They only give one free coffee per person so if you all of a sudden want to order more, they will only let you if there are other people with you. \n\nCustomer service inside and at drive thru has always been okay for me. \n\nWhen inside the restaurant, they give you a ticket order number so your order does not get mixed up with the other orders. I've had my orders mixed up at other McDonald franchises in the past. \n\nThe only, and in fact one of the biggest downfall for me is actually the location of the restaurant. If you want to make a left turn back on 16th avenue, especially during rush hour, good luck as there are a lot of cars on 16th avenue and no traffic lights. They're probably not going to build another traffic light as there's already traffic lights at the fire station right beside the restaurant already. I say if you want to make a left, go around during rush hour."}
{"text":"Ugh.\n\nI went in tonight after a dinner at st.louis, which is almost right beside it, for a sundae with my boyfriend. It was 11pm when we entered, and I thought 'wow this mcdonald's is really nice on the inside. Looks modern!' ...turns out that was the only good thing about it. \n\nWe waited around 20 minutes to ORDER. There was nobody at the till and 3 people running around in the back serving the drive thru. This asian man in a white shirt looked at us several times but made no effort to get someone to serve us. Then at 10 minutes in, I asked the guy \"hey, can anybody come help us out here?\" and he was like \"ok give me a minute\" ...after 10 minutes, the manager for that night came and took our orders without much of an apology. \nThen as we waited for our sundaes, he told us to take a seat because it won't be ready anytime soon and when it is, he will deliver it to our table. We sat down and waited... and waited.. and waited. \nAlso! We had to be quite choosy about where we sat because many of the tables had not been wiped down- there was lettuce and sauce all over a few tables and some were disgustedly sticky. Gross.\nAt 11:46pm, our ice creams finally came and the manager just said 'sorry, our machines were broken...' ..however, we witnessed him serving 10-15 cars in the drive thru window. Since when did drive thru customers matter more than the customers inside the actual store?! Ice cream..... does NOT take 25 minutes to make. \nWhen we left, the trash can was overflowing and sticky, it was disgusting.\nThey're severely understaffed.. I've visited other mcdonalds at 2-4am and it was quicker than that. \n\nBy the way... can anybody give the restaurant # for me? It's on top of the receipt, which we did receive. I want to make a formal to headquarters."}
{"text":"Food is the same as all mcDs! Staff are friendly, very friendly.. It's odd. But I like it.. Lol"}
{"text":"4 stars in comparison to other McDonalds locations.\n\nReally updated location with all the fancy new stuff. Free WiFi, many televisions and seating areas. Employees are quite friendly and quick. I was quite baffled that they didn't have decaf iced coffee however, considering that they have decaf coffee and ice? Seems like a simple equation to me.\n\nAnyways, I don't have much negative to say about it other than long wait times sometimes as well as a strange smell when I came in today, but otherwise it's what you'd expect out of a McDonalds for the most part! :)"}
{"text":"This was for a visit in February 2016...just very late posting.\n\nEasily the worst food experience I've ever had!!  Well, not surprising considering its McDonalds.\n\nAfter a nice evening of gambling and enjoying Fremont Street, I decided on some food. Mind you, this was after multiple drinks. Thanks Jodi and Jenny. \n\nSo, around 2am, there was about 12 people in line. Being a fan of the dollar menu, I was trying to decide on what to order, but the screen kept changing every 3 seconds which made it nearly impossible to decide.\n\nBy the time it was my turn, I still didn't know what I wanted. And the cashier was very rude and demanded I place my order (pointing to all the other people in line). I said, hold on, your menu changes so fast I can't decide what I want. She could care less and kept badgering me to hurry up and order. I finally ended up speaking to the manager, which of course was useless. \n\nIn the end, I got my $1-2 items.  This shit is so bad, it couldn't pass for dog food. I'm surprised it's even legal to sell this horrible excuse for \"food\". But again, its McDonalds. What do you expect?"}
{"text":"They were cool, they just get a lot of business.Customer service was pretty good and they work as fast as they can..\n\nPlease don't expect much, Its just a McDonalds. Ya know,the kind of  place you go to before all the buffets open.That should help bring things back into better perspective. If this doesn't cut it, go a little further east(across the street), and spend $15 for a breakfast at Du pars if you need that sit down feeling."}
{"text":"Cashier was very rude and inpatient. \n\nWhile we were trying to finish out big order she kept rushing us which made us loose track of whose order it was on. Then she charged 2 same things when we just wanted one. There was too long of a line to try to get a refund but anyways. Customer service could be better. \n\nFoods came out at a decent time."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast and efficient. Management and employees very friendly. \n\nMost afternoons; iced coffee w/ shot of espresso!"}
{"text":"Yes, I went to a McDonald's while in Vegas.  I even went twice *gasp* \n\nThe first time was because my friend and I felt that we had lost enough at the blackjack table, so we went to McD's to drown our sorrows in some milkshakes and McFlurries while practicing with a deck of card and some nickels.\n\nThe second time was because we hadn't eaten lunch, but we knew we wouldn't be able to make it until dinner :)  So we stopped really quickly for some fries...and more McFlurries ;)\n\nThe service isn't the quickest, but they are friendly and the food is good!  Stop in for a quick treat!"}
{"text":"Cash only. Line one for busy night. Stinks in here. Bums everywhere. Was so nasty in here. The employees were rude. The lady was taking orders like in 1950 and was so slow and dodmt know how to do orders."}
{"text":"Never been more insulted,  a few minutes ago by Jeanine. Rude, unprofessional and didn't even give me 20 seconds to order,  she asked me to step aside because she had other people that wanted to order. What all two of the customers? If you are in customer service,  learn how to treat customers accordingly. I get it that you hate your job, but don't take it out on me."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Horribly slow to generate orders and then they screw up the orders totally. Worst McD on the planet!"}
{"text":"Yay...polite and very fast for a busy mcdonalds."}
{"text":"Every employee looks like they are miserable. They don't have regular mc chickens only spicy! Rude and disrespectful ..."}
{"text":"Nice hard working people here, but this place is the opposite of fast food, the meals come out very slow! I came in for a happy meal and left with a social security check and a medicare card! Not loving it!\nCome in if you are not hungry..."}
{"text":"These people here are retards. Caught them overcharging my friend for his senior coffee. Then they got my order of two coffees wrong three times in a row. Dude was a punk too shaking his head and acting like a jerk. I think life's gonna be a long road for him."}
{"text":"Just got home from MCD drive thru in Robinson Township to find that my daughter's Artisan Chicken Sandwich meal had NO CHICKEN...what a joke.  Two weeks ago they forgot the Double I ordered.\n\nTHis place has gone down hill and our family will NOT be back."}
{"text":"This is a very good place. Sure,it may look old, but the food was very good. The fries were amazing. But, the only concern was one of my favorite meals to order was not there. Point is, eat here it's very good."}
{"text":"McDonald's rules the fast food nation these days, although many other restaurant chains will be the ones who think they're better than them. While McDonald's can boast that they are the best, they're certainly not the worst - at least not to me!\n\nMcDonald's is one of those places where you just know what you want, most of the time. Some people like breakfast time versus other people who like lunch or dinner time. Sometimes, it's just a french fries that gets people in the door. McDonald's is one of those places where the food is reasonably good and is cheaper than most places out there these days. Very often they would have specials and the dollar menu items to lure people in the door and that's usually how it starts. Nowadays, that's how it is with many of these fast food eateries and still McDonald's is the master of staying on top after decades of continuous changes of consumer tastes and eating habits. Eating at McDonald's on a regular habit while traveling gives me a sense of regularity and familiarity while on the road, while giving me the sense of being budget conscious and the fact that the locations are everywhere, so you don't need to go that far to find one if you're in a hurry. Same goes for Starbucks too. Being that this McDonald's location was basically nearby to my hotel, it was the obvious choice, since it was quick and painless, also I didn't want to over spend on breakfast when I didn't have to. Sometimes, the flow of life goes through McDonald's.\n\nWhile you can have better options at a restaurant Diner, McDonald's can be the one that's better on your wallet, especially when you're on the go. The overall experience here at McDonald's near Pittsburgh international airport was as decent and average as you can get. I was here at about 7:05am on a crisp Wednesday morning. It was nice that my hotel was nearby, so I just walked on over to grab breakfast after checking out of the Red Roof Inn Plus+ Pittsburgh airport south. This particular McDonald's is conveniently located at 6380 Steubenville Pike here in Pittsburgh, PA. It's nearer to the Settler's Cabin Park and close enough to the Pittsburgh international airport, if you are in a rush to get to your morning or afternoon flight out of Pittsburgh. The menu here is exactly what you are used to getting here at McDonald's. The restaurant itself is generally clean and filled with regular customers who love to get their McDonald's fix daily. Prices here can easily fit your budget. From the $1 value menu items to the extra value menus, you can super size them or get\"large\" is the term these days. \n\nFor me, McDonalds tends to favor the breakfast side of things, knowing what I want is the best thing- especially when I do love the breakfast burrito and hash brown! I'm glad that they do serve breakfast all day long, even if it means waiting a little longer for your order to be prepared and served for you. French fries is great and the McFlurry is spot on. For what it's worth, I think the 20 piece chicken McNuggets is a winner, even with the many different dipping sauces you may encounter on your next box of chicken nuggets and a side of French fries. On this particular visit to McDonald's, I ended up getting the two burrito meal and A sausage burrito on the side. The drink of choice was sweet tea, and I ended up eating in and refilling the cup about two times before exiting the restaurant and filling it up I have third time before hitting the road. Just to have something while driving around Pittsburgh before getting on the plane.\n\nTo be honest, McDonald's is there for you in this crazy busy thing we call life. It is what it is and the food is not always that great but it's there for you. Budget friendly and always fast and fresh but not always healthy. Four stars for being budget friendly. Three stars for just being average.\n\nSupport local!\n\nC+"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast to go as it's across from where I work.  I placed my order with Dawn, the manager on duty, and I went to swipe my card to pay and it didn't go thru...she asked which bank it was and confirmed that the bank cards from my bank usually have issues...I just got paid so I know there was money on my account.  She comped my meal, something I would have done in my restaurant management days.  She could have gone the other way, but she provided me with probably the best service Ive received at a McDonalds.  Thank you Dawn!!! You Rock!!!"}
{"text":"McDonald's has it rough...most people probably only review them if they have a bad experience or are ticked off. I mean, what else can you write about a McDonalds except a complaint. Well...my complaint is that this McDonald's didn't freshen their tea enough and their tea is bitter. This usually means that it is either one day old tea or they don't clean the container. Whichever it was, they had bad tea."}
{"text":"This McDonald's sucks if you order breakfast mid day you will be waiting at least 10 minutes I should just go to the Greek diner next-door. Better service better people. I only ordered an Egg McMuffin and why it takes 10 minutes who knows the owner should be ashamed of yourself for not running a better staff"}
{"text":"Worst service the cashiers stop everything to talk to her high school friends, after 5 minutes she decide to get back to work and give me half of my order. Decided that my time was worth more than what I had spent so I walked out with half my order, Last time I buy from this location."}
{"text":"I've only gotten food here once, it was breakfast and part of my egg was black...I didn't bother complaining I just threw it away and never ordered food from here again, but I do always get the iced coffee and it hasn't disappointed me yet."}
{"text":"We always go here in the morning, Enrique is the best and most efficient McDonald's worker I have ever seen. They always get our order right and give us as much sauces as we need. I'll always go here!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for the past 2 and a half years, not very often since I became a vegetarian and this is one of the best McDonalds around. The service is almost always fast and the employees are always nice. I'll have McDonalds hot coffee over Starbucks any day! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest McDonald's drive -thru that I have ever encountered. How in the world do they turn a profit?! I only wanted an ice cream cone and I had to wait over 15 minutes in line for it. The guy's order ahead of me was still on the screen when I pulled up to give my order. He ordered 2 large sweet teas. You would have thought that they had to go out, harvest the tea leaves, and retrieve the water from the well!"}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's ever! The people are rude and don't speak good English. No matter how many times you repeat your order and no matter how many times they repeat what you told them the order is still always wrong. It's actually gotten to the point where it's funny how bad this McDonalds is. Today I asked if they could put $2 on my card and I'll do the rest in cash. You would of thought the world ended lol I had to go to the back of the line for what reason you may ask. Hell if I know! The drive thru is the worst sometimes they speak Spanish the whole time even though you tell them you don't speak Spanish. It's crazy! Funny yes but very crazy. Don't go here unless you're ok with mediocre service and terrible management. Granted it's a fast food chain and on top of that its a McDonald's but seriously it's insane how terrible this place is. Sometimes I think they can't be serious but I guess I thought wrong."}
{"text":"If you want a wrong order, or a drink in your lap, this the place to go for a meal. I plan to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is close to my house, but I go out of my way to go to a different location because this one has disappointed me so many times. Rude employees, extremely slow drive thru, and I swear their sweet tea is always a day or two old because it tastes sour each time! Ugh!"}
{"text":"Slow service and occasionally rude people working. I know it's only McDonalds but what happened to pride in work, whatever that work may be."}
{"text":"Pretty much worse experience I've had with McDonald's. The girl at cashier that initially took my order was nice but other than that this place gets a huge thumbs down. Play area was ridiculously hot seems like AC wasn't working. Food took longer than usual to be ready than I'm used to at a fast food chain. My sons kids meal was missing his juice and yogurt so I had to get up twice to ask for it. And customer service was not very good. I appreciate when they at least attempt to care be quick and friendly. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I grab my morning coffee here 3-4 days a week and today I was treated beyond fantastic! The two lovely folks running the second and third drive through window had such large smiles on their face and they each asked me how my day was then told me to have a great day! It makes the 30 seconds of my morning even better! Keep\nUp the awesome customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"I pulled up to the drive thru and a lady took my order, she gave good service , she was on window 2. The lady who was on window 3 at 5:53 jun 20 was rude. She just opened up her window , almost threw the food at me and shut the window at me without saying a damn word. It's not my fault you hate your job.... Ill just stay to Burger King from now on. I hope the lady who was on window 3 at 5:53 today gets fired and lives in the streets."}
{"text":"Totally confused about the service here. Twice I've been there and the credit machine was down so I had to go to the bank and come back and since I was in line and ordered I had to wait for the line to move to get out of it, usually this happens early am so beware... My order is always incorrect in some way, so I try to be \"safe\" and get the chicken instead of the hamburger, because apparently making a patty and putting it on a bun is impossible, I get it plain every time.\n\nWhen the Hayden location messed up my order and made me wait, which mind you was still fairly quick I got a coupon card but when it happened at Scottsdale, this location, they were like: what do? They wouldn't comp it, although I was waiting for a good 30min total after I got back and ordered, I was offered a smoothie but I got an extra fry to \"make up for it\" whatever it was late and I was tired and over it from waiting so long.\n\nThis visit I didn't get my drink so I just sat there as the staff member was getting the other order. They said they didn't see the drink (set out) so they didn't give me one but a) don't they get the drink and b) I can see my drink order with my order on the screen. Keep in mind there was 1 person inside already eating when I pulled up, and 1 person in front of me getting food and then 1 person pulled behind me when I was at the food window... That is *not* busy at all so where's the disconnect?\n\nGo to Hayden. Get on the ball Scottsdale."}
{"text":"They never get the order right and drive thru takes like forever be sure to double check everything but for what little it's worth i did get Breakfast at 4 so yay!"}
{"text":"We go here because my husband can use the free wi-fi. We like the friendly people that work here as well.\nDebbie H"}

{"text":"i have been to this mac probley 6 times in a 5 year peroid and have gotten food poisening twice the latest boute 2 days ago on a cheese burger this location needs to be reported to the health inspectors. eat here knowing you have a good chance of being poisened"}
{"text":"McDonald's food is Mcdonald's and we all know that going into it, but at least give me decent service. Part of that is getting my order right which shouldn't be hard since I only order 3 things....2 burgers and a drink.\n\nHow I ended up with the wrong drink, one burger and chicken nuggets, I don't know. However, they did do a quick fix for me with only minor attitude for ordering my food right and them getting it wrong."}
{"text":"My double cheese burger and Medium fries were trash worthy. The wrapper was hot so I thought the burger would be.... WRONG! The fries were warm but not fresh, you know how they get when they have set for awhile under the heat lamps. \n\nHowever much to my surprise my frozen mocha was very good.\n\nI called the toll free number and gave them feedback, first time I was ever moved to do that at a McDonalds! They are to mail me out a coupon to replace my burger and fries. I will not be cashing them in at this location that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Horrible location! I ordered a large combo meal and got a small fry and no sweet and sour sauce for my nuggets! How do u not read the screen and do your damn job and give people what they order?! Thanks to their stupid employees i now have no dinner to eat. I cannot and will not eat the nuggets without my sauce! I order the nuggets FOR the sauce."}

{"text":"This McDonald's is the cleanest one I've been to in a long time. Very fast. Prompt service. The manager Steven is awesome. He is keeping his restaurant and people on track. Very professional service. We need more people to be professional like Steven."}
{"text":"So Kevin and I were having lunch an McDonald's. After which we had a smoke, it's a slightly warm day so I'm standing in the shade of a tree, and a car is parked in front of the tree, no biggie. \n\nNot two minutes later, this elderly lady comes out and asks if I needed something with her car. I simply said that I was standing there for the shade. She then accused me of tampering with the hood of her car. I once again politely say that I was simply standing there for the shade, by this point I've already moved from that area. She goes back inside the McDonald's. \n\nA minute later, the manager comes out saying that the lady is a friend of the owner and thinks we're messing with her car. Once again I say that I was simply standing there for the shade. He then takes on a haughty taughty tone and says, \"Well she's a regular and friends with the owner, sorry. I hope you guys have a nice day.\"\n\nAt this point we leave feeling like we were singled out by this stupid woman and just because she's friends with the owner that they could single us out for something we did not and we're not doing. Fuck this McDonald's! I will never go back there and I urge you to do the same!!!"}
{"text":"This is not a great McDonalds. Thats saying something.\n\nTo be honest, when I go to McDonald's I am really going for one reason: sweet and sour sauce. Its tangy, its sweet, it clearly has heroin in it because when I don't eat it for a few days I start feeling like bugs are crawling under my skin. Everything I get there is just a delivery vehicle to get the SSS (sweet and sour sauce) into my mouth since apparently you high society types frown upon me using a spoon or straw. This means generally I am getting a lot of of chicken nuggets or fries, though I'm not above putting some SSS on a mcflurry...\n\nThe major problem I have with this place is that despite me saying I will pay extra for SSS and them charging me for extra sauce packets they basically never give me the desired number of sauces. I get you don't want to give away huge numbers of sauces anymore cause neoliberalism but... come on give up that sweet golden brown goodness. \n\nChicken nuggets at this place have been pretty consistently bad- not super hot, not super crispy, all around meh. \n\nLastly, this McDs is slooooooooooooow. The drive through line is frequently quite long and slow moving which is terrible for a fast food restaurant.\n\nLuckily between work and home there are 3 McDonalds on a 10 minute drive- America."}
{"text":"Disgusting! And I eat mcdonalds weekly ! I know sad but this place is disgusting ! When I'm paying almost $4 for a fast food Greece sandwich that I do admit I love I get A hard as a rock called chicken Brest in stale bun the is cold ?!!! So disappointed and disgusted I have never yelped but it was that bad I as too and now with the sandwich in the trash I'm still hungry and $10 down ! Disgusting !!!!"}
{"text":"The second star us just cause it's mostly clean.\n No one behind the counter has a clue. I asked if they had any pies besides apple. She said cherry, so I ordered two. Then when they handed me the order they said they only had apple. Got my money back.\n They told us four times they don't gave vanilla, just sugar free, so when I reminded them about the extra shit they argued, because it wasn't on the receipt. I told them I had ordered it, then they said they didn't put it in because they don't have vanilla. I had to point out that I ordered sugar free.\n Four other people left upset while we were eating.\n Bad service, all the way around."}
{"text":"12:30pm:  The woman who took my order was pleasant enough.  The manager-type who put out my order seemed harried.  Not sure who was responsible but I had to ask for my drinks.  It was the rush hour so I'll give them a break, although I did notice the pick-up counter was getting backed up with people waiting for corrections.\n\n2:00pm:  I ordered a sundae for me and a shake for my son.  The man who took my order was very pleasant.  Although  it was not busy at this point, the manager-type still seemed harried and flustered.  I saw her make the shake and then disappear.  The young man who brought out the sundae had to go looking for the shake and found it at the drive-thru window.\n\nThe good parts:  the Playland space was clean and the wifi worked.  Oh yeah, and it was cheap.  The ice cream was very good.\n\nIt just bums me out that I could have gone to In-N-Out, where they always get my order right and they are friendly and efficient.  If it wasn't for Playland, I wouldn't go here."}
{"text":"ACTUAL IS ZERO STARS - A NEGATIVE NUMBER WOULD ALSO BE APPROPRIATE.\n\n2215.  About quarter-after-ten of the p.m.  Running a bit late on my way to work, so stop by the McDingle's closest to the Nest to put a snack in my mouth to accompany the pharmaceuticals that say \"take with food.\"  I pull into the drive-thru line, and about fifteen seconds later, I hear a burst of static.  About five seconds after that, I hear, \"Hello?\"  Now, I'm thinking, *I did NOT just hear that.*  I know they hire youngsters here, and they have to train even the slightest shred of professionalism into them, but this reaches an all-time low.\n\nThat mental conversation took about five seconds, after which I heard \"Hello, are you ready to order?\"  Again, no \"thank you for choosing McDonalds\" or anything like that.  I said, \"No thank you, not today,\" and drove off, rolling my window up.\n\nAs I said,  this is the outlet closest to my home, and I've been in there many times in the year-and-a-half I've been in my home.  Never anything to write home about in either direction ... nothing outstandingly good, or outstandingly bad.  This, however, is the proverbial last straw.  I guess I will start packing a brown-bag every day before I go to sleep to make sure I have that small amount of food that my pills require.  It will probably be cheaper and healthier in the long run anyway.  As my grandson might say, \"Good-bye, McFail.\"\n-- -- -- -- --\nOn the newly-established Nighthawk 100-point scale:  5.  (Yes, that's a single digit, not a typo.  Five.)"}
{"text":"Everytime I go here they get something wrong about 75% of the time. I guess it's my fault for going here due to convenience and location. But this time I have to say something not only was I in the Drive-Thru line for more than 11 minutes which is a lifetime in Dr which is a lifetime in drive-thru world. I ordered a Happy Meal for my daughter and already the fry container is already really small but on top of that they couldn't even fill that small container. Not much of a Happy Meal as far as I'm concerned. The picture I am submitting is an untouched container of fries."}
{"text":"Good service at the drive thru.  Their employees know what they're doing; nobody looks distraught or scattered at the pick up window.  Always acknowledging and not in a hurry.  Today, I believe was the manager at the 1st pay window; waited for a response to \"how's your day?\".  Gotta answer that hungry people!\n\nThey make their mango pineapple smoothies nicely; never too sour.  Sour only happened to me at one McDonald's in CA.  Fries have been just done, hot and crispy with some soggy - how I like it.  My order is simple and always right.\n\nOn the last visit made here for a snack lunch, the young man actually repeated my order again as he handed the items.  What impressed me was he indicated \"and here are your large fries with napkins and ketchup packets in the bag.\"  I checked - yes correct.  Every other McDonald's I've been was more like \"here ya' go\".\n\nJob well done guys! Acknowledging, orderly, correct change, correct order, repeat the order, provide necessary straws, napkins, packets etc, polite farewell and thank you, with invitation to return... Like a quality checklist being actualized."}
{"text":"This McDonalds has really gone downhill.  Today I ordered a biscuit with egg and cheese only and a parfait.  The Biscuit I got had sausage only no egg, no cheese and the parfait had a hair in it.  Last time there for me!"}
{"text":"Wrong every time.\n\nI only go to this particular McDonald's because it is close to the house. I don't seem to learn though.\n\nEach time I go to the drive thru  my order is never right the first time.  Now I know you may think this is an exaggeration but I tell you no! It is true. This last time I was the only one in the drive through and when I was handed my order it was completely wrong!  I ordered  a Big Mac   large fries, large coke, and 2 double cheeseburgers.  What was in the bag they handed me was Filet o fish, small fries and  2 apple pies. At least they got the large coke right. \n\nBelieve me when I say I really want to like this place but am disappointed each time."}
{"text":"Its a McDonalds, clean but staff is young and immature."}
{"text":"Been awhile since we've been at a McDonald's,  but the sausage biscuit with egg and breakfast burrito tastes consistently good. Service was okay.  Love the iced coffee with hazel nut."}
{"text":"Yelp really needs to allow a 0 star rating! Nothing irritates my consumer soul more than a place who messes up on their end and then take minimal or not effort to fix it. I went through the drive through and ordered a 6 piece nugget meal for my daughter. Get home fries-check, aplle slices-check, but 6 nuggets not so much. Like how do you not box the main item???? Call the location and spoke with manager and explained issue and that by the time I come back my complete order will be cold. Go back up to the location and wait 8 minutes just to be handed a small bag with just 6 nuggets in it. Really???? This location obviously does not comprehend what good customer service is. You mess up my order at no fault of mines that require me to make double trips to get my order right and all you offer to do to suffice is supply what you forgot in the first place and then stand there with a blank look on your face like you have no clue as to why Im an upset customer. They could have thrown in a few cheeseburgers and I would have been okay with it but show some type of good faith effort."}
{"text":"Slow as a slug, and they usually eff up my order but its ok.\n\nI continue to go here for sweet teas with lemon, and when I order food they usually forget something Im ok with that. This place has a horribly small through lane if you dont wanna go through th drive thru, SO BEWARE!! We also go here bc they have my sons Mcdonalds night so we go and eat out little ice cream with fries and enjoy the AC.\n\nThe drive through is SOOO SLOW and the workers are usually rude but what do you expect? They hate their job, but please dont forget my lemon in my sweet tea!\n\nCheap fatty food, but if youre in a semi rush or dont wanna cook go for it bro!"}
{"text":"Five stars for fast food?\n\nI rate places based on how well they meet my expectations. I do not have very high hopes for fast food places. But today, at this location, I was greeted with such a friendly welcome, quick service, and a clean environment that I am honestly impressed.\n\nCourtney and Bri are *exactly* the people that you want as the face of your organization. Suddenly, instead of seeing McDonald's as a corporate behemoth, I see hard-working Millenials doing their best to create a positive, friendly business. \n\nWell done, folks!"}
{"text":"HUGE MOTH IN MY SOUTHWEST SALAD!!! I always order salad and iced coffee from here. But after today never again! I bought salad from there on my way to work. When i was almost finished with it i saw a fat nasty dead moth in there.. I ran to the bathroom and puked! I went back and all the girl did was refunded my money and gave me corporates number to call them she said there was nothing that she could do... Now in afraid ill get sick!! Im never eating there or any mcdonalds again!"}
{"text":"Got my order.  Beats me why McD always has such low reviews. Service seems pretty good to me. Then again I just order a soda. Opened the door for this older lady. After sitting down with my drink she was still ordering with the counter clerk. She tells him she is 85. Thin Asian grandma type. Conversation is a little comical since she won't leave the counter waiting for her food. Could've swore she asked for egg rolls?\nAppears she ordered an egg muffin. Have not seen someone eat it one bun at a time. The crew were nice and brought it out for her on a table. Good service for a fast food if you ask me. Just observing human activity as I am waiting for the social security office to meander through the queue. (Should've gotten my sleeping bag.)\n\nNormally I reserve 4 stars to good restaurants as the coveted 5 is used sparingly but I think they are a 4 as far as fast food is concerned. The tables are clean. Floors cleAn. Restroom freshly mopped. Nothing I can complain about really."}
{"text":"Wish there was an option for zero stars \n\nCame for a quick late night bite thru the drive thru ... Big mistake the wait was outrageously long, the workers were on there phones,  goofing around , the food was cold and after the guy confused our drinks and after we corrected him he still gave us the wrong drink. Waste of time & Waste of money."}

{"text":"I work downtown and this McDonald's location is just 3 mins walk from my workplace,it's NY'S eve and some of my favorite places that I usually get my lunch at are closed and this McDonald's is open so I went there and I ordered the big Mac meal,one guy was probably been waiting for his one burger for more than 10 mins,total wait time for my order was 25 mins,and the place was not even busy,no line,just me and this guy waiting for our order. All the crew at that time didn't give a da*n if you've been standing there waiting or if you only have 30 mins lubchbreak,no customer service,place is dirty, very slow service,I've been to this location a lot of times and everytime is a bad experience. And one more thing,in the summertime,this is where weirdos hangout outside. Avoid this place if you can."}
{"text":"I don't eat at this McDonald's on a regular, but I have gone here multiple times when Downtown. Contrary to many of the reviews, I actually haven't had any issues other than this location being relatively busy. Now, it could be because I haven't gone here as many as times as others. But my experience has been simply ordering my food and then taking off in about five minutes. In my opinion, this McDonald's is pretty large so it can accommodate several people."}
{"text":"This little mom and pop shop is the -premiere- date spot for Pittsburgh's growing ghetto community. Seriously though, what can be said about it? Well the location is great, which merits a star, if you are coming from or going to work and need a bite to eat, Pittsburgh's integral T and bus stations are just across the street. The food here isn't bad, and the restaurant has plenty of seating. Now for all the down sides.. The service here has never been great, I know it's McDonald's and it's in a busy city center, but you can always count on many lines and a lot of young employees joking around and goofing off here. Not only this, while you are waiting in said lines you can observe one of the following: someone trying to sell you stolen items; a homeless person accosting you for change; someone making a huge scene about how long their food is taking; teenagers just hanging around with no intention of even eating there. I mean this is one of the biggest companies in the world, you think they could at least afford one security guard! Similar scenes can be found at the restaurant's tables. I remember they had clearly posted detailed \"no loitering signs\" and literally there were homeless people napping at the tables under them. I used to dread coming in here. Dos estrellas."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is pretty scary but for a cheap fish sandwhich I'll go in. \n\nCurrently they are doing a Lentin special of $1 fish on Fridays."}
{"text":"It is a dump. Every loser in PGH goes here it seems or stands around outside the store. Feels dirty and I am a guy. Homeless bums central meeting spot."}
{"text":"When I go to a McDonald's, I know what to expect in terms of the food. In this case, the food was just fine. The ingredients were fresh and it tasted just as I expected. The reason that this restaurant gets just one star is that the customer service is among the worst I have experienced. How can you have just one person taking orders at 8:30 am on a weekday morning? The line was at least a dozen people long at all times. The cashier was pleasant and doing her best, and the manager was trying to take orders whenever she could. However, whoever makes the staffing decisions for this restaurant just does not care about customers or customer service."}
{"text":"There are three things in life that are constants.  Death, taxes and McDonalds on a side street.  Connect the dots."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible the entire time there I felt like I was gonna get mugged or killed, above that employees are asshole and there's all these signs, rules and your only aloud to stay 20 min if you eat food.. You can drink a water bottle in here from your back pack cause they kicked me out cause the beverage wasn't purchased here  unbelievable and the bathroom have locks and requires manager permission like this feels like prison!? What tf am I paying for prison food and prison feeing also everything is 100 times more greasy then any McDonald's I went to and they burt my chicken nuggets fuck this place"}
{"text":"You. Yes you. The one who actually looked up reviews for a McDonalds, you know who you are. I'd just like to remind you, ITS A DAMN MCDONALDS! You go into this with the full knowledge that the employees don't like people, you'll sit for 20 minutes in the drive thru, and you'll most likely poop out the meal you just ordered within the next hour."}
{"text":"workers are pure evil - don't piss them off. drug dealing in the open, bring cash. junkies sleeping next to you - don't wake them. this place needs a security guard and better employees. ugh. go to the Stanwix location, you need the walk after any meal served here anyway - be good to yourself."}
{"text":"Always very dirty and extremely rude. Bought a full meal that looked as if it had been sitting out for hours. I've been to quite a few McDonald's in my life time and it's safe to say this has been the worst. I've given it a few chances given its convenient location, disappoints me even more every time."}
{"text":"I go in 2-3 times a week before or after work because that's right where I take the bus.\n\nIts McDonalds. Downtown. In Pittsburgh. Considering how nasty and dirty this city is, especially its Downtown, its no surprise that this store is pretty nasty and dirty. Ironically enough, its not nearly as nasty and dirty as the rest of this nasty, dirty city.\n\nAs far as the Downtown McDonalds, this one has the best service. As far as the food...its McDonalds. It always tastes the same. Some days the staff just isn't on its A-Game and the sandwiches are literally thrown together. Other days, its made properly and neatly. I always special order my sandwiches so that I know its freshly made and they've never messed up an order.\n\nThe service here is the best for the Downtown McDonalds. They're usually nice and pleasant. They're prompt and courteous. Some of them even smile."}
{"text":"I usually don't have problems with this location even though I get irritated with their employees' attitudes sometimes. Today, however, my experience annoyed me more than usual because of the dumb people who work there. \n\nThe one worker that I absolutely dread encountering is the slightly older woman with glasses who is on the heavier side. She has the worst attitude out of all the workers there and it is clear that she hates her job. She is just not friendly at all and can never get an order right. \n\nWhen I drove up to the pick up window, a teenage employee was there and gave me my bag of food. I ordered two combos. I waited about 15 seconds for my drinks, and he was awkwardly standing there, wondering why I didn't drive off yet. Then he asked, \"Are you waiting for something else? That should be it.\" I said, \"...We ordered drinks too.\" He looks behind him and there are my drinks! \"Oh!\" he exclaims. As I am situating the drinks into my cup holders, I hear him say, \"Here.\" When I turn around towards the window, half of his arm is in my car and the straws almost hit my face! WTF?! I was so irritated by his incompetency. \n\nAlso, one thing that I don't like is how two drive-thru speakers are built, but the employees are always confused by which one to use. For example, I would order at the first speaker. When there is a long line, I get stuck at the second speaker and a worker tries to take my order there when I already ordered at the first one! Sometimes I tell them that I've already ordered, and sometimes I ignore them even when they're constantly asking, \"Hello? Are you ready to order?\"\n\nIncompetent workers and a confusing drive-thru! So annoying."}
{"text":"McDonald's usually is good for an inexpensive, decent quick bite when you've been drinking. However, I hate clarifying 2 times that I'm ordering an unsweetened iced tea and receive a disgustingly saccharine sweet tea. I mean, this location is one that you order face-to-face through drive-thru!  \n\nHere's the conversation:  \"I'd like an unsweetened iced tea,\" I pronounced. \n\n\"sweetened or unsweetened?\" asked the careful listener. \n\n\"unsweetened,\" I replied. \n\nYou know the rest of the story...\n\nOh, and the southern style chicken hockey puck was both dry and burnt. \n\nThis McDonald's receives 1 star because they were able to make a usual shitty dining experience even shittier."}
{"text":"Good location, s-l-o-w service.  Funny crew, on a trip through the drive thru, the cutie taking my order for a Happy Meal, asked if I would like a girl or a boy toy?, I excitedly answered \"Oh!, I'll take a Boytoy!\", he must of thought I was a dirty old lady, he'd be half right!"}
{"text":"The worst McDonald's ever. Each time I place an order they screw it up. EVERY SINGLE TIME! \n\nThe managers are not professional and act like it is the customer's fault that the order is wrong. \n\nSeriously, it's not rocket science. Get it together. \n\nIs it really that hard to count to 4? They can't even count the kids meal chicken nuggets right. \n\nRidiculous. This location needs new managers and new staff ASAP!"}
{"text":"If they had no stars available i would give them no stars- the management has failed to train their staff properly or the kids they hire are just dumb and lazy- either way i have contemplated working there as a manager just to overhaul the staff. I have yet to have gone through the drive thru and get what i ordered. The poor reviews should be a wake up call to this mcdonalds manager and owner- get a clue! I will no longer be visiting this mcdonalds and i hope this review along with all the other 1 stars help dissuade any future customers."}
{"text":"Ok \nWe have a consistent problem with this McDonald's. Specifically with the coffee. And that's too bad because McD's coffee is typically very good. \n\nToday's problem is the decaf. Old. Very old. I'd say from late last night possibly but certainly not brewed this morning. We should have went to the coffee shop next door. \n\nPreviously (& not yet posted) \nAlmost without exception either the coffee or the service is just awful here. I started asking for cream/sugar on the side because they screw it up.  The coffee is sometime cold as well."}
{"text":"There is one reason and one reason alone that my family comes to this McDonald's - and it's the PlayPlace. With NV's awful winter wind and scorching summers, it's a nightmare place for kids that need to run off some steam. \n\nWe come here with my 5 year old sister and 8 year old brother so they can run around and to grab a drink. Usually, this location is packed with kids. This McDonald's is more expensive than other ones."}
{"text":"We came here the day after Christmas with our 2 kids and our nephew to quickly eat breakfast.  We were greeted in a very non friendly demeanor by this older woman who just couldn't get our order right.  Once we got our order, she still got it wrong and I went back and said something to her.  No apologies.  She would not give me the small coffee I wanted instead of the large coffee and she short changed us a sausage burrito.\n\nSo, I bought another coffee, even though I should not have had to pay for it because I was in a rush.  She just had a really sour attitude and I know she probably doesn't like working there, but it's not my fault.  She accepted working there.\n\nSo, for that, I give her a 1 star.\n\nHowever, the next day, we did come and the younger man was in her place and he was pretty much perfect.  Got everything right.  Great attitude, no issues.  I give him a 5 star."}
{"text":"I usually do not care to write reviews for fast food chains, but this was the strangest experience we have had in a drive thru in a long time.  When we pulled up to the first menu, we did not see a window so we glanced at the menu and pulled forward to the next menu where the intercom usually is located.  We did not see one and another car was already behind us.  We went around the building thinking that we missed it at the first menu only to find that located at the second menu was a big unlit sign stating that it was \"personal face-to-face service\" and we were to order at the window...really???  We pulled up to the first window and no one was there and neither was there a sign stating to move forward to the next window.  We took the risk and pulled forward.  A few seconds later a lady wearing the supervisor uniform took our order while giving another employee a hug and having a conversation with another employee.  Then we saw the car behind us paying for and placing their order at the first window!  Then the lady who took our order came back with our food and was trying to give us some change when she realized it belonged to the car behind us.  The food was cold and old...very confusing and horrible experience at what should have been just a simple drive thru service.  I am not surprised by the low ratings this location has received."}
{"text":"Oh man I'll stay away from this location. I've been here several times and every time I have problems. One time I got a filet o fish in a Big Mac box, another time the manager gave me a hard time about a coupon, and this last time No- ice cream \"can't you read the sign\" \nRude manager = rude employees"}
{"text":"It's bothersome when i asked the guy on the window 3 times if the toy inside the happy meal for my girls was actually 'for girls'\nHe smirks and said yes all 3 times. \nI get home and the toys are for BOYS! \nGet it right or man up to say you dont have girl toys."}
{"text":"McDonald's will be McDonald's so I've based my review on service alone. cashier had no personality. He didn't smile or even was interested on working. He looked and sounded miserable taking my order. The manager on the other hand gave me my food with a smile and even cracked a joke. it was a morning shift so that employee needs to cheer up and smile more and spread positive vibes especially when people are just starting their day."}
{"text":"I forget that I'm at McDonald's when I visit this location. It is very clean, and the food is fresh. The indoor play area is large and new. Service is good...could use a few more smiles. Sometimes I feel as if the cashier (same one each time I went) is annoyed that she actually has to work when I go up to order. But my order was always correct. I definitely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Been here a number of times with my granddaughter.  Worst McDonalds I've ever been to.  The staff is consistently rude.  NOT a happy place.  I'm thinking bad management."}
{"text":"Walked into this place for the first time to get an ice cream cone while my wife shopped at nearby pet store. The older lady wearing glasses behind the counter asked me if I wanted it To-Go, \"To-Go\" ? it's an ice cream cone. Anyway I said To-Go, this lady then gave me the biggest Yarn as she handed me my change, then I watched her drop some kind of plastic cup on to the floor, but didn't pick it up right away. She looked like she didn't want to be there at all. i watched her prepare my ice cream cone, then she decided to pickup that cup she dropped on the floor earlier, what gets me is the way she picked it up, looked like as if she was picking up a 400 lbs weight at the gym. Then, as she was handing me my ice cream she says to me \"Welcome\", \"Welcome\" for What?  I haven't said my Thank You yet !,  as if she was doing me a big favor.  I grewup in Japan where a customer service is probably the best in the world so maybe I'm little too critical. But I do know one thing, if this was a McDonalds in Japan, she be so Fired !"}
{"text":"Loyal McDonald's customer for years. This location has the worst customer service, worst attention to detail, slow service, and always forget something or get my order wrong. Try to avoid this location at all costs just to avoid a headache."}
{"text":"Horrible !!!!  The teenagers who work here are more interested in socializing than serving customers.  I have been coming to this location for over a year because it is close to my house , but must say I will drive a little further now just so my order will be correct !  I dont understand ????? Are suburb teenagers IQ's going so far down that they cant get even master a cheeseburger fries and drink order?   I get excellent correct orders at Maryland pkwy and trop location on my way to work!!!!  I challenge the owner if this location to order  a meal here and I would be beyond shocked if it is hot and correct!  One example: i ordered a cone a diet coke and 2 coffee.  They give me 2 coffee.  I say \" my cone?\"  He looks at the big bright screen with the order and  says \" oh ya \".  Gives me my cone.   Then a few seconds pass.  \" my diet coke ?\"  Once again another long hard look at the screen followed by a puzzled look and another \" uggggghh oh ya\".  Need I say more.  Go somewhere else !!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this McDonald's a negative star I would!  Absolute worst McDonald's I have ever been to.  They NEVER get your order right.  The kids taking your order are usually texting or on their cell phones while you are trying to order.  The fry containers are always half empty.  They ALWAYS have a hand written sign hanging up on the drive thru that explains what they are out of.  One time it was hamburger patties!  We live around the corner but choose to drive an extra 5 minutes and go to any McDonald's that is not owned by the Lipscomb & Smith franchisee. Terrible....F!"}
{"text":"This McDonald's venue is about as great as McDonald's can get.  The food is consistently quality, hot and yummy.\n\nI have eaten many a breakfast here and nurtured my coffee in the bar high to seating they have out front.  Their staff knows how to run a great show.  Fast service and super friendly and competent.  They do a great, great job. \n\nLittle funky sometimes navigating the parking lot with the twists and turns when Las Vegans are feeling testy and pushy, but other than that, great place. \n\nOn the extra points side, they have a PlayPlace!"}
{"text":"Clean. Has playplace. New looking. Have no idea why so many bad reviews. Maybe I just got lucky."}
{"text":"This McDonalds is absolutely awful.  It always seems like it is never open, its not open 24 hours like most locations, and the service is very horrible and slow.  The line is always long and as said, the place is so slow.  Their quality for a bacon egg and cheese biscuit is very low.  The best location is Pecos and Bonanza.  This one Valle Verde and Paseo Verde is the worst."}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's you can go too.  Always messing up on your orders even though they have a full staff and they aren't busy. Bunch of idiot employees specially the managers since it happens very often and they don't reprimand the employees.   Serious actions need to be taken for this place to be nice and amazing again."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give a star but I have to, but this is seriously the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. And I've been to some very sketchy places!\n\n1. The lady who took our order was rude and rolled her eyes at me when I could t decide what I wanted. \n2. She glared at me when I asked for a small cup to give my 1 year old water. Umm, sorry, I can't give her soda so I don't need a large cup, just a little one. So she handed me a plastic cup for ice cream. \n3. I needed a bag to take the rest of our food but they said bags cost money and didn't give us one. \n4. I asked for a cup of hot water to heat up my daughter's bottle of milk and the gentleman gave me a small cup that the body wouldn't even fit inside. When I asked for a large cup, he said he couldn't give it to me bc cups costs money. Shit! I'll pay $0.05 for the stupid cup then. So when the manager finally gave me a large cup, she asked for the small cup back and was about to put it back to be reused. Umm, wtf gross!!! I had l call her out on it and watch her throw it away. I'm not saying my hands are gross but that's totally not sanitary to use a cup again that's already been used. \n\nPlease for your sake and your child's, don't come here. Rudest employees ever!!! I apologize that I spent my money here."}
{"text":"Went here for Breakfast with my Grand daughter. She loved  the play place. I ordered  the bacon egg biscuit, hash browns and iced coffee for me and since they do not have happy meals at breakfast time( they really need to come up with a happy meal breakfast!) we ordered scrambled eggs and bacon for her. My biscuit was very dry and the hash browns were cold in the middle. Scrambled eggs were not fully cooked but bacon was nice and crispy."}
{"text":"This mcdonalds is just weird.. I have been thru the drive through, ok experience. There iced coffee is way more expensive then anywhere else I have ever been too. I guess they charge there for extra pumps of flavor. Never seen that before, but whatever. The other day we went in to grab breakfast. WOW is all I'm going to say. DIRTY! Do they ever dust or clean? The card readers had gunk on them and full of I have no idea. The pop area looks like they never cleaned it in days. The floors... I was just disgusted, and I couldn't even eat my food knowing how clean the back was. I think I will stick to another location.. I rarely eat mcdonalds but I crave it once in awhile (breakfast) the lady wasn't too friendly either..."}
{"text":"I read the rest of the reviews and thought they were completely inaccurate. \nWe came here as a pit stop heading back to Arizona. Everyone was completely friendly, fast and efficient. They even mentioned to us, to make sure to ask for the \"senior discount\" before we order to ensure that we get it. Clean and has a play place."}
{"text":"Worst McDonalds in the history of McDonalds. All of their employees are rude, serve cold food, and have bad attitudes.. Your better off with Taco Bell  a mile away. \n\nDon't waste your time, or money."}
{"text":"I am only giving this location one star, because you can't give zero stars. This location can't get anything right. First, my order is wrong or incomplete 7 out of 10 times. Second, the food comes out cold or the fries will not be salted often. Third, a manager/shift supervisor was extremely rude to me simply because I went through the drive thru w/ two separate orders. Fourth, if you want ice cream it's a crap shoot. You never know if the machine will work. TERRIBLE! Worst McDonalds on the planet!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a typical Mcdonald's with a play area that's great for kids to run around and burn off some energy.  It hasn't been renovated like many other Mcdonalds around town but I'm sure it will be done sooner rather than later.  Food was exactly what we ordered and was hot and tasty."}
{"text":"I usually come to this McDonald's after 1 am on a Friday or Saturday night, and they always say they are only accepting cash, and they don't give you a receipt. Very sketchy. They must lose a lot of customers since not many people carry cash. They've also gotten my order wrong a few times, so now I make sure to check my bag before I leave the window. I wouldn't recommend going to this location, the employees are probably pocketing the money. I've never had a problem with paying with a card after 1 at any other location."}
{"text":"We ordered two food items from the drive-through during lunch. The person who took our money at the first window at least said, \"hi.\" The person who handed us our food at the second window did not greet us or say thank you. They simply handed us our food with no acknowledgement. Based off off this experience, I see why they are rated 1.5 starts. We won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Can mcD's get five stars. ?\nI think so. My opinion. \nIt's based on my expectations. \nDo expect mc d to serve food like Bobby Flay? For 6 bucks. \nOf course not. \n\nPerfect b fast sandwich. Kinda cool. \n30 seconds to my car... Hot would've been five stars. \nPotato fry hot. Little greasy still. Needed drain time or a sit on a paper tray. \n\nExceeded my expectations. \n\nClean and more upscale than most locations."}
{"text":"I got off work and headed to McDonalds arrived at 9:50pm and waited in the drive thru for like 3 minutes with no answer. Backed out, see a guy (worker) snot rocketing a booger and smoking I cigarette and immediately left. I don't know what time this McDonalds closes but I know it couldn't be any earlier than 10pm. Have been to this location once before (again after work) roughly 10pm and they weren't nice over the intercom. I just find it CRAZY that I only ever have complaints about this location. Sucks that it's the only place, later at night, on the way to my house, for food."}
{"text":"You gotta hand it to this Mickey Ds. They continue to maintain a high cleanliness standard, whilst providing quick and friendly service. Out of all the times I've visited here, it's always quick and friendly. Props to the Valle Verde team!"}
{"text":"Drive thru service was impeccable..positive energy from the crew ..would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Why do I keep falling into this hellhole?!\n4 times, yes, 4, the most I chances I have given a place...either they:\na) Are out of whatever you want.\nb) Have bad attitudes.\nc) Give you cold food.\nd) Give you melted down frozen strawberry lemonade that looks like puke, I should have taken a picture so that you would know I am not making it up.\nI am going to yell now, ready? STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"Who reviews a McDonalds? No one. This review can be considered an obvious joke. \n It's McDonalds. \n You're going to spend $3 to get the wrong order every time. That's part of the fun- Lunch Roulette!"}
{"text":"It's McDonald's. Unprofessional employees, many of which are owner's family, openly complaining how hard/often they work, etc. Since Mr. Rice owns all the Pittsburgh (non-corporate) stores, I don't expect this to change. Ever. (talk about job security)\n\nNew cashier, Lama, is very nice; warm, friendly,  hard-working.\n\nMcDonald's, as a chain, over the past 10 years, is not a draw for kids. It's become more suited to adults, more of a coffee house that just happens to serve food.\n\nHowever, I think their premium salads are decent.  I've read and heard too many stories about lack of machine cleanliness to order a specialty coffee.\n\nSo, there you have it."}
{"text":"This McDonald's seems to be easily confused. However, it's an older crowd late afternoon so the employees may not be 100% to blame. Our cashier was limited with English yet blamed me when she made a mistake. It was a simple mistake but that is very rude to a customer."}
{"text":"Picture it: a beautiful, clear Saturday night in Pittsburgh. After going to a Pirate's game where they got their Bucco Behinds whipped 25-0, who wouldn't want a McDonald's hamburger? (Yes, I'm slightly exaggerating - just go with it). Alright, so I pull up to the drive through. The dude on the intercom asks for my order. Meanwhile, in the background, a little Mickey D's partay is going on. There's whistling and shouting. Hm...Why wasn't I invited? So he takes our order to the best of his ability, even with all that background mischief going on, and guess what? This dude forgot to give back the credit card! Late night shopping trip, anyone?  Be careful."}
{"text":"Walked in weds Sept 28, music blaring. Slowest McDonald's staff on earth. \nMessy, depressing. They need a management drop in, terrible."}
{"text":"What is going on with this McDonald's?  It was so messy and overrun by local tweens.  Tweens behind the counter as well.  Why do you wanna know my name when I order? This isn't Starbucks. And how come no one changes the garbage? Why is it just, OK that the washroom is broken and you have two floors of seating?  That's insanity.  BOTH washrooms are broken? Get real.  I can respect your efforts to keep the nightcrawlers and unruly tweens from just wrecking the washrooms though.  I bought a mango pineapple smoothie; it stunk. I dunno, the food was okay, but the ambience is just not upto par. Tweens or no tweens."}
{"text":"Had to stop in a Canadian McDonald's just to see how the fries measured up north of the boarder...They same GREAT!!"}
{"text":"The McDonald's Empire does a commendable job of having consistent food. Where things tend to diverge a bit, is in the area of service, restaurant layout, and other intangibles.\n\nHere are some things to note here...\n\n1. Ridiculously long waits during peak times and after school. Don't expect a free single French fry or an apology for waiting way too long.\n2. There is minimal seating downstairs. This is not a good place for strollers , wheelchairs, or people with limited mobility.\n3. They do not give refills.  You have to ask for just about everything ( ketchup, paper products). While I am sure this saves the franchise owner lots, the place just seems cheap.\n4. The place, partly because it does get slammed at times, can be dirty.\n5. One plus is that the upstairs dining room does have a window view of the street. Another is that there is no smog creating drive thru."}
{"text":"Came to this place with Bae not knowing what to expect. First of all, there was no hostess there to seat us! So we had to go find our own table. The only free table we found was dirty so we HAD to clean it. And then we waited almost 3 hours before a waitress finally came and told us they were CLOSING THE DINING ROOM?! EXCUSE ME? We could have had 3 meals in that time but now we're absolutely starving and being told we won't have time to eat?! Ridiculous service. Come to think of it, I don't even remember seeing any of the other tables being served either, and eventually all those people just up and left too. I've gotta say, maybe if the staff could up their service a little bit this place would be a hidden gem, the food on the menu looked pretty good. But for now, all I know is that its gonna be a long time before Bae and I decide to return here."}
{"text":"Ok, lets start with this..i've visited many locations across the world and nothing compares to my local mc d's. I'm convinced this location is contending to be the #1 worst! It doesn't matter what you order, they'll -A. Mess it up, B. Take eons to put it together, or C. B.S their way out, not taking ANY responsibilities that they are at fault. Unfortunately, i believe all who work there are quite special! Multi-tasking doesn't seem to be part of their training. As for the management, they are also quite useless! I haven't seen them to rectify or deal with any issues..instead they actually hide! How horrific!! This place definitely needs a spring cleaning from top to bottom..too bad the renos didn't fix the staff/service :("}
{"text":"Key Features: No drink refills, no shakes, and no accepting of McDonald's Gift Certificates. \n\nYeah, yeah, it's a Mcdonald's.  They're all the same, right?  Clearly not.\n\nIf all McDonald's were the same, what would be my point of reviewing this one?  Maybe it's because I'm lost in a sea of watching Star Trek Voyager, and I wanted something better to do than just watch Kes' inane actions. \n\nBut that's not true.  People need to know that this McDonald's is differant than others.  Namely for the key features listed above - but you're also looking at ridiculous lines.  If you get here between 2:50 and 3:45 when the local schools are letting out, be prepared to line up longer here for your McWhatever, than you would at most of the restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped by at the drive thru and greeted with \"What's your order?\". I was speechless for a moment there coz I was expecting a \"good morning or hello\" but wow oh wow... What a way of customer service. Horrible!!"}
{"text":"I've here tons of times per month for the last 6 mos.... took my business to this location after a nearby Mc D's kept screwing up and giving me the wrong order entirely every time, including giving me diet soda.\n\nToday is like the third time in the last 2 weeks that I've ordered a DR PEPPER and got a DIET COKE, which I'm incredibly allergic to! Thanks for not taking the time to be careful of giving people something they didn't order! Maybe you guys need to be educated about artificial sweetener (which diet is worse for you than regular btw, readers) being a major 'food' allergy, before someone gets a lawyer. If it was my grandpa we were just getting a soda for, he'd be in the hospital right about now.\n\nThanks guys for making my insides burn for the next several hours!! I really (DON'T) appreciate it!!!!!"}
{"text":"First of all let me say that this McDonalds doesn't have a sign in their drive thru stating that they charge for Ranch. \nSecond of all customer service sucks here. I know that you can't expect them to treat super great but at least have respect. The stupid cashier at the 2nd window was Rude about me asking for ranch then got her manager which wasn't that nice either.\nThird of all when I get home, my order is missing! I was missing one of our burgers. \nThen I try to call them but no answer. Why do they have a phone if they won't answer? So guess what store#18966 I call the 800 number and did a complaint. Hope you learn to have respect, I'm not asking for u to all happy and jolly JUST RESPECT!\nForgot to mention that my husband's fries where half way full! What's wrong with them!"}
{"text":"Very Very RUDE employees! Starting with the managers!!!! I have gone here a million times cause I live down the street & every time I go they're rude their food is NEVER fresh even when you ask for fresh food they never do it! I got a crispy chicken meal the fries were old & the chicken was uncooked.. Me & my husband went there to have lunch one day & we sat by the door & I over heard a employee tell the manager \"Ramon\" that there was a DEAD RAT outside by the door, he grab the broom & dust pan to pick it up I'm pretty sure they used that dust pan & broom the clean there kitchen... Disgusting....."}
{"text":"Don't eat much here but, I'm only writing this review because the cashier ( which was the manager) was using her phone when she was taking my order. How rude! Plus this employee kept on looking at me. It made me so uncomfortable because she kept on eyeballing me with her old saggy eyes."}
{"text":"Drive thru menu showed the same price for Ala carte & meal.  Figured they were having some promotion.  \nWhen I went to pay, cashier said $2 more than menu price.  When I asked, the price she said a different amount.  I told her what the menu said, she said she would get the manager.  I explained what was going on, manager told me I was wrong & asked if I wanted him to go look at the drive thru menu.  Sure.  He left me in line, with line backing up, came back and still said no, I was wrong & for me to go check myself.  I paid full price, drove back around & looked.  Manager came back out front.  We're standing arms length from the board, not 12 to 15 feet back where the cars order, & can see, underneath the glass, the bottom part of the 6 has been removed, so at a distance, it looks like a 4.  Even after manager acknowledges the problem, he does NOTHING to rectify.  One of the WORST customer service experiences.  I took a picture to send to corporate.  I told manager board should be fixed, because it's false advertising.\nIf he had honored what the board DID say, rather than what it SHOULD have said, this McDonald's would have kept a customer & not received a negative review."}
{"text":"This is a good McDonalds it is usually pretty busy though, inside is nice and well kept, it's actually one of the nicer interiors of a McDonalds that I have seen In the valley.  The drive through is usually pretty busy due to the layout but its usually quick.  The food I get is good and if you haven't tried it get a McDouble with Big Mac sauce, i highly recommend it, it's excellent!!!"}
{"text":"They always close an hour earlier. It says 11 even at the door and I've tried to get food for the kiddos at 10 and the door is already locked and they say they are close. Also they take hours to get an order ready, I once waited 40 mins for ONE BURGER. It always happens . I used to try to get breakfast from there before going to work but it's impossible unless I arrive there an hour early, staff is friendly I just hate the actual service."}
{"text":"So many need jobs all over and these rude individuals should be greatful to have jobs.  Place was clean and bathrooms. Servers chit chattin including the management.  I waited because I needed help. Server blah face no smile. What happened to McDonald's served with a smile? Not here that's for sure. Will not stop again not even if working in the area. Don't bother!"}
{"text":"Just happened to be working in the area and really needed some chow.  While on the way to our destination given the short amount of time we needed to be there and the direction we were going, we ended up at this location.\n\nI have not rolled into a fast food drive-thru in sometime.  I also did not consort the app prior to our arrival.  This was a moment when you see the \"Golden Arches\" and make a split second decision to visit.\n\nUpon arriving at the squawk box..given the cold tone of the server at the other end, I was filled with dread thinking this is going to be a mistake.  I ordered up a fried chicken sandwich, some fries and a sweet tea.  \n\nMoving on to the next window, my trepidation was confirmed by the blunt, no smile serving clerk taking our money.  This was confirmed by the no smile serving clerk at the next window handing out the meal.\n\nWhen we arrived at our destination and I reached into the bag for my meal, I found the fries and sweet tea to be all that is McDonalds.  Those items built around the centerpiece of the sandwich I so wanted to enjoy.  Just like the robotic order taking, order serving experience I had received, the chicken sandwich had no soul.  I would have derived just as much pleasure eating the wrapper it came in.\n\nShame on you McDonald's location and shame on me.  Given the geographical location, I should have known better.  But mark my words........I WILL NEVER COME BACK!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible food. The burgers were left out way too long and the fries weren't even cooked all the way. Don't go there if you don't want to waste your money or time."}
{"text":"Second time I have gone through Drive-Thru and ordered Chicken Nuggets for my nephew.  They always forget the sauce.  Called to let them know it has happened twice.  The girl on the other end of the line said to check before I leave that it's in there.   I am paying for a product and checking to see that someone else has done their job.  Sad."}
{"text":"Finally left early enough for work to allow me to get a McD's coffee. I don't like the fancy coffees, just regular coffee with cream. I decided to be quick, avoid the drive-thru and go inside. My luck there was one person ahead of me, while there were at least 5 cars waiting outside. I liked the counter displays. They were a variety of coffee cups and mugs presented in such a way as to look inviting. I thought it was a nice touch. \n Well, my turn came and I realized just how slow the cashier was. It was as if she had not a care Umbria world. After a few moments she finally took my order. Another woman actually made my coffee quickly, and I was headed to work. My disappointment came when I realized that the coffee tasted bitter. Burnt. Ugh. I will try another McD's closer to work next time. What a let down."}
{"text":"Went today 9-3-15 through the drive-thru at 12:05 PM.\n\nI wanted to try the new buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich.  The first thing that struck me was the bun...it's very dark in color on top and no sesame seeds.  The chicken itself is much flatter than their old crispy chicken sammich and slightly...peppery?  It's very tasty.  \n\nMcDonalds fries are my favorite of all fast food french fries.  When they're hot, there is just something magical about them.  But give them five minutes and they become toxic waste.  \n\nThe best part about my excursion to Mickey D's today was that I didn't get stabbed! Yay for me."}
{"text":"Well I was reluctant to go into a 2 star mcdonalds, but it wasn't all that bad. \n\nInside was relatively nice, and the employees were pretty friendly. Of the breakfast meal I got, I only changed the coffee to a large iced coffee, and got a large hot coffee instead. When I spoke out loud to myself saying \"oh is this hot?\" She thought I was just asking if I would burn myself haha\n\nI didn't bring it up because iced coffees are usually more expensive anyway. Either way, the sausage egg biscuit was pretty good!"}
{"text":"This has gotta be the cheapest McDonalds in McDonalds history, they never give napkins at the drive through. I ordered 5 sandwiches and five large fries, asked for extra ketchup and was given 2 packets and told that was the maximum they can give me. When I asked the girl at the drive thru four the manager she got all pissy and threw a handful of  ketchup in the bag and asked \"happy now?\".\nneedless to say it's a terrible place to order food"}
{"text":"What do you want me to say. It's McDonald's in the hood.  It's dirty outside,  inside,  in the bathrooms and even the tables were gross.  We had to move a few times as almost all of the tables had some sort of food stuck on it.  The cashier had our order wrong and when asked to correct as we received our order, my husband was told \"well you should have specified what you wanted sir\". Yeah um no!"}
{"text":"I went to mc Donalds today for lunch today, April 19, 2016 and the food I received was horrible. I ordered the buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich, and the bun was burnt, the lettuce was wilted and brown. I was so disappointed with attitude the management had how they treated me. If possible  please don't use this location, unless you enjoy bad customer service, food that appears to be old and cold and extremely long lines in both the drive thru and the walk up counter."}
{"text":"While seeing my food sit at the drive through window, I watched as the lady preferred to attend the coffee maker and then after taking her time I finally got my food as she handed me the food waiting at the window.... I could have left way before that! My fries suck and the nuggets are rock hard!"}
{"text":"McDonald's made headlines recently because business has slacked off slightly for the first time in corporate history.  The company is used to record sales & profits year after year.  To get things back on track, they're experimenting with a revamp of the menu.\n\nIf there are many outlets like this one McDonalds is way off base in their diagnosis of slumping sales. They need to upgrade their facilities.\n\nThis location is purely wretched, downright disgusting.  The furniture is beat up.  Every square inch is filthy.  Paint is peeling or worn. One of the soda machines was down for repair.  Rather than cover it, they left it naked so everyone could see the filthy disgusting machine where their soda comes from.  There is absolutely zero pride of ownership here, but I'll bet the proprietor has a nice home in Summerlin (if they're local).\n\nThe only bright spot was the friendly order taker. I wish I'd noted her name.  I hope she gets out before working at this McDonald's scars her for life.\n\nI had a bacon McGriddle with hash browns & coffee.  It tasted off.  Very off.  I think the problem was rancid cooking oil.  The coffee was surprisingly good, if you like strong coffee.  \n\nAll the while during our visit, a crackhead girl stood in the lobby chattering nonstop in a grating voice, not pausing to take a breath.  She and the man she was with appeared to be not just homeless but homeless with addiction issues.  Their clothes were filthy.  Their skin was a combination of deep tan and caked on dirt.  They fit right in at this location.\n\nI don't know what got into me.  My stomach was growling.  There was a Jack-in-the-Box across the street.  I loathe Jack-in-the-Box.  Now I wish I had gone there instead.  Or better yet, skipped breakfast."}
{"text":"The service sucks, the food is sub par for a McDonald's.  Management can barely speak English and when you ask to speak to another manager they shut the window on you and say \"no he not here\" I will make sure to inform everyone I know of this McDonald's.  It may not make a difference since the name sells itself but they may choose another one."}
{"text":"This place is nasty. Slow not cleaned and unhelpful staff. Corporate should be ashamed to let this happen. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I ordered 20 piece chicken nuggets, sweet tea, and french fries. I ask for extra ranch and it's almost 30 cents for ONE small ranch. To top it off the chicken nuggets were stale, french fries were rock hard, and the tea was more ice than tea. Never going back to this location."}
{"text":"absolutely horrible!! close this place down already or get new management!!! horrible customer service very dirty ive been here 3 times and every time they have got my order wrong!? something should be done with all the complaints they have received"}
{"text":"Worst excuse for a McDonalds I can think. Of. Drive through service sub par, don't even give you the total. Wrong orders. An increase in minimum wage. Not for this place. Management not responsive"}
{"text":"This is the worst McDonald's I've every been to..service was horrible they gave me a water wit a bug in it and looked at me crazy for bringing back to them this after they gave me stale hard fries. On top of poor service and food the place was filthy..the floor was sticky and visibly dirty and the men's room was disgusting. We will never return to that location."}
{"text":"I had the most awful experience at this McDonald's last night. I went thru the drive thru and ordered 20 pc chicken nuggets with 3 BBQ sauces. My order was correct on the screen and receipt. When handed my bag I asked about the sauces. \"They are in the bag\" is what I was told. I get home and no sauces. I drive back down to the restaurant and request my order be remade because now the food is cold. I was told by the manager Leo that he was not replacing my food. So McDonald's had to throw the food away and gave me my money back so I could go across the street to Jack in the Box. Thanks Leo for making my restaurant selection easier for the future.  I would not even give 1 star but it won't let you post without it."}
{"text":"Der Wrap meiner Freundin war frisch zubereitet und lecker. Mein Chicken Gourmet war mit altem Salat belegt und folglich meilenweit von den durch den Namen gweckten Erwartungen entfernt. Die Bedienung gab sich wortkarg und wirkte unmotiviert."}
{"text":"Ich gehe schon seit einiger Zeit in diesem Mc nicht mehr aus diesen Gr√ºnden:\n\n\n 1. Mc Rib kalt und hart wie Stein\n2. Salat √ºber 2 Tage abgelaufen\n3. Big M√§c fader Geschmack\n4. Pommes alt ( mehrere Stunden)\n\n\n Und als ich mich beschwert habe bekommt man noch b√∂se Blicke!!!\nAus diesem Grund wenn ich Lust auf Mc bekomme gehe ich nach Wangen."}
{"text":"Wie der Mc am Bahnhof nur noch absolute Frechheit. MAs die einen anpflaumen weil man mit Coupons bestellt. Man bekommt nie Boubbletee, bekomme immer die Antwort heute gibt es keinen. und das kam auch schon t√§glich immer zwischen 18-20 Uhr vor. Wollte es mal √ºber Wochen Testen. ich vermute man wollte dort das Personal lieber an den Theken stehen haben weil es mehr Umsatz bringt. das einzig positive sind die Toiletten. Sehr nette Toilettendame und diese Klos sind immer sauber. das ist aber auch das einige positive."}
{"text":"Ich kann die ganzen sehr negativen Bewertungen nicht ganz verstehen.Es ist ein ganz normaler Mac wie vor 20, 30 Jahren. Mitarbeiter, die teils sehr schlecht deutsch verstehen, auch nicht unbedingt den seri√∂sesten Eindruck machen. Aber, bei meinen letzten Besuchen in den letzten 2 Jahren war das gegen√ºber fr√ºher deutlich besser. Auch wurde der Laden grundgehend renoviert und sieht nicht mehr so abgerockt aus. Dass die Kunden die Toiletten zusammensauen und im Restaurant vieles versch√ºtten, daf√ºr kann die Crew nix. Gerade diese Filiale muss auch oft besonders prek√§res Publikum aushalten. Das Essen war nie zu beanstanden."}
{"text":"Dreckig. Ekelhaft. Schuld sind die Kunden"}
{"text":"Der Mc Donalds liegt in einer seitlichen Stra√üe der K√∂nigsstra√üe und bietet eine recht kleine Grundfl√§che, daf√ºr aber drei Etagen. Somit besteht auch gen√ºgend Platz, man muss nur auch die anderen Etagen ber√ºcksichtigen. Die Toiletten befinden sich in der zweiten Etage, dort sitzt auch ein Wachhund vor der T√ºr, bzw. eine Wachh√ºndin, die einen unfreundliches leise hinterherruft, wenn man ihr nichts gibt.\n\nDie Waren ganz normal, die Sauberkeit allenfalls m√§√üig, das Personal teilweise nervig. Die Dame an der Theke fragte uns drei mal in k√ºrzester Zeit nach unserer Bestellung obwohl wir sie jedes mal um einen Moment zum schauen baten.\n\nEinziger Lichtblick: Es scheint mir als k√∂nne man in der ersten Etage drau√üen auf dem Balkon / der Terrasse sitzen, allerdings sa√ü hier Niemand trotz 20 Grad im April. Ob dies nun Zufall war oder ob die Bereiche nicht zug√§nglich waren kann ich nicht beurteilen."}
{"text":"Schmuddeliger McDonalds ohne Refill-Station und ohne McCaf√©seit der Renovierung sieht es ein wenig besser aus, das Publikum ist jedoch vor allem abends unertr√§glich. Das Essen ist schlechter als in anderen Filialen, vor allem was die Frische der Burger angeht! Geht lieber die paar Schritte zur Marienstra√üe hoch!"}
{"text":"Ein typischer Innenstadt-Mac. Wobei man dazusagen muss: oben ist es eigentlich ganz h√ºbsch, es gibt sogar Pl√§tze auf der Au√üenterrasse.\n\n\n Leider ist es nicht besonders sauber.\n\n\n Die Kassenkr√§fte bem√ºhen sich, aber einige k√∂nnen nicht richtig Deutsch.\n\n\n Diesmal wurde der Big Tasty probiert. Er stellte sich als eine Art Big Mac heraus, nur dass die eigentlich ganz leckere Big Mac-So√üe durch ein undefinierbares rosaorangenes Etwas mit penetrantem Kunst-Rauchgeschmack ersetzt wurde, den man - leider - noch Stunden sp√§ter im Mund hatte.\n\n\n Ungenie√übar.\n\n\n Irgendwie sind wir nicht auf dieses amerikanische Kunstessen gepolt, wir bevorzugen richtige Lebensmittel.\n\n\n Wenn √ºberhaupt dann irgendwann mal wieder ein Big Mac."}
{"text":"Also hier kann von fast food  keine rede sein, die Dame am Tresen war so langsam, das schon ein Teil des Essens kalt war. Zudem war die Frau echt unfreundlich.\nUnd daf√ºr das dort jemand vor den Toiletten sitz und Geld nimmt, war die Toilette echt schmutzig."}
{"text":"Das Restaurant ist nicht sehr sauber. Die Thekenkr√§fte scheinen nicht richtig geschult und die Pommes haben schon etwas gelegen.\n\n\n Im Prinzip kann ich den anderen Beitr√§gen zustimmen."}
{"text":"This location is very busy. It is bigger than it used to be and the entrance is fairly big. There is a generous playplace for children which was closed when I went. The bathrooms were also clean. The only reason I would take off a star is because there was only one person taking orders, so it took longer than expected to get my coffee and apple pies."}
{"text":"It really depends on the day of the week you come and the time of the day you come... can find it clean as a whistle or dirty as hell.\nIn store is slow drive thru is slow.\nbut its open 24 hours and for a quick meal who can complain."}
{"text":"I now know why I hardly hang out at McDonald's.... even when they started to having their McCafe and their Iced Coffee is $1.\n\nKids screaming! Stop the kids screaming!! I know it is kind of exciting to be jumping up and down and run around... but just do that inside the kid's play area? Sigh....\n\nFree Wifi was working perfectly! CP24 would have make someone happy!\n\nI am glad I am here not too often but there was no sight of a Starbucks close by and it is near the airport. Great location to wait for someone's flight to arrive......"}
{"text":"Working nights limits one to local fast food joints. I think I've over done the heart clogging food crave. I come to this McDonald's almost every working day and its taken it's toll. I come only for the convenance now. Not because I like the food. Trying to eat healthy or to make healthier choices just doesn't happen at this location after 1:30am. They stop serving salads or anything with grilled chicken. I think I'll just have to start bring a lunch from home. Will be lighter on the gut as well as the wallet."}
{"text":"The place was okay and I liked their mcflurries but you have to wait for a long time. I like their fish tank in the middle and the employees looked really nice and was kind. I usually just go their for dessert because I like their ice cream and coffee"}
{"text":"After any good night, a stop at the Maccas is in order. If you don't like this place, this may change your mind. \nHere's what you do: buy a mcdo ble with lettuce and big Mac sauce on the side. Get a junior chicken. Take everything and build 1 big burger. Eat it. Thank me later."}
{"text":"Its the best to drive tru. Was ok , clean and staff were polite. Large drink & fries were really large.This location is well managed.Almost fast service and free internet.\nIt offers a wide variety of food and drink items and offers slices of cake and also pastries, croissants and muffins with the McCafe. The menu is listed on wide flat screen monitors which makes it easy to read. The staff is friendly and we liked the atmosphere. The washroom is clean and comfort."}
{"text":"Whats there to say about McDonald's?\n\nWell this location is usually good, the food most of the time is hot, especially the fries which McDonald's is famous for giving cold fries ...\n\nThe drive thru moves fast, making this a convenient and one of the better locations."}
{"text":"Free Wii-Fi and nice ambiance; however the room is unkempt. Came in for a free coffee after I finished the 'buy 7-get 1 free' card. When She asked for money, The server told me she forgot about the free coupon! The cappuccino was good though. It would be nice if the staff took interest in wiping down the tables at least once per day."}
{"text":"Nice location but they don't want to serve you if you are Australian... Very hostile towards Aussie customers. Fish tank is beautiful however"}
{"text":"Drive thru experience is the worst. Ordered breakfast sandwiches and was told to pull over and wait. However, they had to make three return trips inside to get the pieces of my order that they forgot. Totally unacceptable!  Worst thing is that it's been like this for years at this location. Horrible customer service and managers and owners don't seem to care."}
{"text":"Took my date here. She loved the exotic fish tank and the happy meal."}
{"text":"The McDonald's at Yonge and 16th is my go-to place for McDonald's as it's closest to me. Sadly, the drive-thru quality is horrendous. I've had orders given to me that weren't mine and I've ordered items that I didn't end up receiving: you name it, I've experienced it. Once, I asked for my fries to be cooked without salt and instead they gave me cold leftover fries with salt. Did they think I wouldn't notice?\n\nThis place is pretty bad. If you want a quick McDonalds fix, but are willing to risk compromising the integrity of your order, then go to this McDonald's."}
{"text":"Waited like 12 years for fries. They gave me a Big Mac and when I got the fries the Big Mac was extinct. Horrible customer service too"}
{"text":"I've never seen a McDonald's with this level of filth. Many of the previous reviews specifically comment on the lack of cleanliness, as well as the lack of concern for improving the situation. \n\nIf this is a company store, the manager needs to be fired for mismanagement; if it a franchise, the franchise owner needs 72 hours to fix the problem, else needs to forfeit his franchise due to failure to operate this store according to MCD operating policies. As a MCD shareholder, I expect that the company operate (or cause franchisees) to operate with industry-leading policies and procedures. I can't think that anyone who is neither blind, nor unconcerned with hygiene, would put something produced in this restaurant in their mouth. \n\nShape up!"}
{"text":"Everytime I eat here the people working seem to have a chip on their shoulder. Like I am wasting their time by ordering. They are lucky they have the convenience factor going for them. Avoid if possible."}
{"text":"This was the dirtiest McDonald's I've ever been inside of. Their lobby had trash all over,and looked as if it hadn't been cleaned since last night.(and not very Well at that.) And there manager was rude when I brought it to his attention,he rolled his eyes and walked away! What great customer service. I,for one,will not be eating here anytime soon.gross"}
{"text":"If I could do it no stars I would what a joke horrible customer service from the manager filthy restaurant beware of this place"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a salty snack before getting ice cream. There was a police officer standing outside. That's always a little off putting. Got our French fries and iced teas (used Apple Pay!) and sat down. The fries were very good. Hot and fresh. The police officer came through and asked some people if they were going to order food. I guess they have a loitering problem here? It made us feel slightly uneasy, but we were only there a short time and went on our way."}
{"text":"Yep I work in the ghetto...although this shopping center and the surrounding area is new it's still the ghetto... This place has to be the slowest \"fast food\" place ever!! Ordered the breakfast with hot cakes...the hot cakes were rubbery and of course they forgot to put the condiments in the bag... Well you know what they say..the screw you in the drive through... This place sucks and a shame there aren't any others down the street to go to."}
{"text":"It a McDonalds..... how much can i say?!  Anyways, its a newly updated location that is very clean and modern looking unlike the older McDonalds that are out there. The drive-thru has 2 lanes, so there is never a large wait and the service is friendly!"}
{"text":"Definitely longest wait ever at mcdonalds. I waited for 20 mins in line for coffee with just 3 cars ahead of me. I would have just left but unfortunately there is no place for you to be able to get it out!!"}
{"text":"This location literally is down the street from me and I used to frequent it all the time when I still believed I could inject/inhale pure fat + NOT work out and never gain any weight.  Needless to say, I haven't been to this location for the longest time until a few weeks ago to pick up some for my brother.  It hasn't changed.  \n\nSame old disrespectful, careless tards working the drive thru.  When I pull up to the window to get my food, the person handing me my food just stares at me.  Not a \"hello\", not a \"thank you\", not a \"have a nice day\" ......I'm not expecting you to CARE but part of the etiquette of working in food service is to not look like your best friend just died and least say hello to the customer.  \n\nOne time I asked for a large Dr. pepper and I was handed a small one.  So I told the girl working the window that she gave me the wrong size, in which she proceeded to snatch the drink from me without  an apology or any type of acknowledgement and then yelled very loudly and nastily at someone (while the drive thru window was open) \"YOU DIDN'T TELL ME SHE WANTED A LARGE?\"  Then pops back out the window and asks me \"You wanted a large drink?\"   YES MOTHAFUCKA.  That's what I just told you!  Ugh wthhhh.  I wouldn't be surprised if she spat in my drink.  \n\nMy most recent trip?  I know I'm Asian but I'm told all the time and know for a fact that I have ZERO asian accent  - SO please tell me why when I placed my order, the person inside acted like I barked out the equation for a hyperbole?\n\nThey have hoodrats working in this joint.  These people should quit and sell drugs instead."}
{"text":"The way folks study the menu here, you'd think they were picking baby parts. Hint to all --its the same shit you ordered last week. The employees are still the sane, too; perfectly paired with the food. The cashier didn't care what i ordered. Had to ask how much money i gave her and why. (Change was a nickel.)"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. I came here thinking I was gonna feed my family and much to my surprise their credit card machine wasn't working. Very disappointed, especially the service. I forgot to mention that my brother in law said he had the same problem the day prior. Safe to say I will not return."}
{"text":"I went to this location, late night around 3am, and left the drive thru window around  3:30am. The clerk was chit chatting with his friends/family member for almost 30 mins. Cars were lined up, and waiting. Late night service was an absolute disaster."}
{"text":"I live near this location. The day crew has has been on point. But when I come home at night, from around 11 to 2, my order has been wrong 50 % of the time.\n\nIf I wasn't hungry and tired, I would drive back and yell.\n\nWhen I order breakfast food, it's because I want breakfast food.\n\nI'm going to Jack In the Box from now on.\n\nIf I could give zero stars, I would."}
{"text":"Just went to this location with my husband and got a mcwrap... Kind of. The food was barley put together in a way to make it possible to eat. The container holding the wrap had most of the ingredients at the bottom of it. So almost nothing was left inside of the tortilla. It was almost as if they took the chicken one cucumber and some lettuce in the wrap and threw everything else at the bottom of the box because they forgot to add it. I know it's McDonald's and I shouldn't expect much from them, but at least be able to make your wraps as actual wraps and not salads in a box"}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru to buy my daughter and I some lunch. She had gotten a kid happy meal with apple juice and I had gotten a snack rap with a drink. The cashier who took my payment was friendly and fun and took my payment quickly. Now the woman at the second window where I got my food. Talk about not friendly and kinda rude. She didn't say one word to me not even hi. She handed me my food and then immediately shut the window. Now I know they are busy but still where is the hospitality? She even forgot my daughters apple juice and I had to waive down the lady to get her juice. If I have to go to this mcdonalds again im definately going inside and avoiding the drie thru staff by all means!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through and got home and half my order was missing. Called to complain and the person on the phone didn't seem to care at all. Never going back."}
{"text":"Every single time I go through the drive-thru I don't get a straw. I don't know how this keeps happening. Every time. Even when reminded."}
{"text":"Please go to the other McDonalds (not too far from here at 120 Penn Cir W).\n\nOne time while using their drive-thru service, we realized they forgot to add an item on our receipt. We asked how much the real total is and the employee told me, \"like $5.00.\" WHAT!?!!?!!  CAN YOU PLEASE USE YOUR REGISTER TO TELL ME HOW MUCH THE ACTUAL TOTAL IS!"}
{"text":"I don't expect much from fast food restaurants. But I do expect to be spoken to when I am a paying customer. I just went through the drive-thru at this location and, other than taking my order at the speaker, no one said a word to me. There was a different person at each window, and neither of them said hello, your total is, fuck you, nothing. I don't think I've ever encountered such a miserable bunch of people. \n\nMaybe they're upset because their heroin operation was shut down."}
{"text":"They are literally the SLOWEST fast food restaurant I have ever been to. We have tried going through the drive-thru TWICE and BOTH times have left because after someone says \"hold on one second\", you're still waiting to order 10 minutes later!! Do not go here. There there is one right down the street that is faster!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the low reviews. This is a very well run neighborhood McDonald's where retired folks seem to gather over coffee in the morning. I have been here a few times and service was always prompt and courteous. The food is consistent with McDonald's everywhere and the restaurant clean.\n\nMy only complaint was free ATT WiFi was slow on my last visit."}
{"text":"I wish we had a way to hold this corporation accountable for its crimes against our society."}
{"text":"This place is horrible how did the 5 customers behind me get there food first. And when i ask why this was happening the manager got a attitude with me and slam my food down. Forget remodeling this place replace the people."}
{"text":"Decent McDonald's. Best thing about it is the inside is large and wide open so it's very comfortable to sit inside."}
{"text":"No Shamrock shake for me, just a McDouble and a Diet Coke to quiet the rumbles. Even though I was clear with my order to be eating in, it still arrived in a to go bag. (He also forgot the drink, but was reminded by a supervisor.) I took a table where I had a view of the counter and watched the same guy miss two other drinks.\n\nMy burger was a little on the messy side with ketchup and chopped onions outside the bun.\n\nFree wifi is a plus and the parking is good. But I would have to say that I've had better experiences at McDonalds. Give this one a miss."}
{"text":"This place was recently upgraded and it looks great!!  New staff as well.  4 stars."}
{"text":"Why does a fast food chain place get five stars in my book? B/c they offer Shamrock shakes. Big deal right? No. I went to three McDonald's the other night looking for one and none of them had them or machine was \"broken\" (i.e. they already cleaned it and didn't want to make it) I may be a little obsessed but Shamrock shakes are top notch in my book. When going through the drive thru at the Wendover location, I told the employee at the window how happy I was about the Shamrock shake and he told me that he was happy for me and I quote \"Your hair looks good, boo\" Just what I needed to hear after getting my hair done. Love."}
{"text":"Breakfast all day if you want what they have available.10:30 am and you can only get a biscuit."}
{"text":"Everytime i come here there is problem with the food and the attitudes with every worker here. I mean seriously its the closest to my house but not even worth the trouble. I mean really."}
{"text":"Disgusting! Huge black hair! Nestled sweetly between the sausage and the cheese. By the way I'm blonde. Manager was like \"oh we are sorry about that\" no sympathy or customer service in her voice. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst McD's I've been to (unfortunately closest to my house) and it seems like the reason why is management. In the 5 years I've been going here, I've had many incorrect orders, been overcharged several times, had inconsistent or poorly made food/coffee, been treated rudely when trying to get problems corrected. I've had to wait FOREVER because of understaffing (or maybe they're just that bad). A couple times they asked me to pull ahead at the drive-thru and wait for them to bring my food out to me. Both times it was clear that I had been forgotten, I didn't order much at all and watched for 10+ minutes while people behind me drove off with their food and drink. I actually had to call and remind them I was still waiting! The icing on the cake is I just found out they raised the price of the McWrap from $3.99 to $4.99, the only McD's in the area that has done this. So you know what? I'm done with this location. If I absolutely had to have McD's again, it'll be somewhere else. Whoever owns this franchise needs to get a clue.\n\nOne last tip to this location... Try putting an adequate amount of sauce/mayo on stuff so people don't have to order it with extra, which sometimes backfires when you actually get \"extra\" (better than not enough IMO, but still way too much). Seriously, you want me to come back behind the counter and teach everyone what a \"normal\" amount of sauce looks like? It's not hard people..."}
{"text":"Since when is serving frozen hash browns a new thing?! Went thru drive thru, didn't check order for home and bit into frozen hash brown. Most of the time food is cold. Hate to travel to another location, but going to have to. If just happened once, I can get over it, but multiple times, inexcusable."}
{"text":"Why oh WHY did I even come back here last Saturday night? Well, self, because you quite frankly had major munchies and needed salty food bc of your vodka consumption. That's why.\n\nI do, however, regret consuming food at this McD's location - even in my drunken haze.\n\nMy Filet-O-Fish (towards the end) had a long (about 3\") white hair in the tartar sauce. I started gagging and spit out the burger and the rest.\n\nNever again. Never!!!!"}
{"text":"Go to this McDonald's locations drive-thru and order 3 things.... chocolate shake, vanilla cone but in a cup - for my boys and fries.  When I got to the window to get my food nothing was ready... you mean with 3 people in the restaurant your staff can't get this ready? Then I look up and realize there is one person already pulled over waiting for what they ordered which ended up being one of their iced coffees. Manager finally comes out with my shake and the boys ice cream, forgets the fries and a straw.  You are a manager? Really? Are you that out of touch? Did you just bring me a shake and no straw and totally forget my fries.  I guess you just can't fix stupid.  I will NEVER go to this location again. Reading the other reviews this store seems to have an evil twin, one really good at what they do the other they just can't get their crap together."}
{"text":"Good play area, seems fairly clean as far as indoor play areas go, with clean family bathrooms right by the play area.  What I like about THIS McDonald's is that the food (from the drive-thru during lunch rush) is usually hot and fresh, this doesn't seem to be true for other McDonald's.  Yeah they've occasionally messed up an order or had unusually long drive-thru waits, but I don't think any fast food chain is without it's issues.  This is definitely my go-to McDonald's, even if I have to drive past another one to get here."}
{"text":"Exactly what it says, Eek! Methinks not. \nFor one I have been going to this mcdonalds for a while because its near my house obviously. However, I hate dealing with this one person Vanessa. Shes argued with me before and other times I have gone she argues with almost every other customer. I've argued with her about what I said over drive thru that I wanted a orange juice. Other time I have been there she argued with this one older man who looked maybe hispanic. But then the next customer was white and her whole attitude changed. I dont know why she's still there and why the managers let her talk back to customers like that. Is this seriously how McDonalds is to become with out spoken rude employees. Are we ever going to have good servers who make your day first thing in the morning???"}
{"text":"I have had a few bad experiences at this location.  Usually it's an incorrect order.  But today took the cake.  I went to the drive-thru and ordered 2 Big Macs and a Large order of fries.  They asked the car in front of me, and myself to pull around and park in the \"reserved for drive-thru customers\" spots.  I did.  The gal came out and gave me two bags.  I asked, are those Big Mac's?  She said yes.  I went home.\n\nUpon arriving at home and opening the bag, I discovered that she had actually given me the wrong order, which meant she gave the wrong order to the other car also.  So, I went back inside.\n\nI went inside this time and explained the situation and showed her my receipt.  I was apologized to repeatedly and was offered a free drink while I waited.  I refused.  Soon, the Manager brought a single bag out and apologized again.  I asked if my original receipt was in the bag, because I wanted it.  She said, \"No.\" and went to get it.  I took the receipt from her, and only then, did she ask if there was anything else she could do for the inconvenience.  I said, \"No\".\n\nThis is a BIG difference between McDonald's locations and other establishments.  At some places, when they screw up, they will give the customer a coupon for a free meal or in the case of Smashburger, two $5.00 coupons.  Not so at a bottom-of the-barrel chain like McDonald's."}
{"text":"I have been a regular of this location for several years.  I live close by.  4-8-15 after a long hard day at work went through the drive thru ordered my double quarter pound cheese burger value meal with extra pickles, large fries and an ice tea.  Had to wait a bit but that was OK figured it would be fresh.  Got home settled in opened my burger and to my surprise there was a bite already take out.  YES a bite.  Went back to the store spoke with the manager and she said she had no idea how that happened.  REALLY!!!! someone took a bite out.  That's how it happened!  She is going to review their in store video.  I highly doubt that.  Got my money back.  This is a franchise store.  Got the owners name and number have left him a message and filed a complaint with the Arizona Board of Health.  Told the manager I will never be back.  She seemed surprised at that.  DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I give this McDonald's 5 stars because of how fast and effecient they are. I often come here before work for coffee or a McMuffin and the line can get quite long, but it has never taken longer than few minutes to get through the drive thru. Perhaps it is because they utilize both drive thru windows. Doesn't it seem like most fast food places make you go straight to the second window, making it less efficient?"}
{"text":"Ok, I know it's McDonald's and my expectations aren't really that high, but there are 2 things about this McDonald's that really irritate me.  \n1.  When I order a burger without onions, I expect it to show up without onions.  This doesn't really happen at this McD's.\n2.  When your dollar menu has an item on it named \"sausage mcmuffin\" and I order a sausage mcmuffin, I don't want to be asked EVERY time if I want a sausage mcmuffin with egg.  If I had wanted a sausage mcmuffin with egg I would have asked for a sausage mcmuffin with egg, since that is what it is called on your menu!  WHY do you have to ask EVERY time if I want the mcmuffin with egg?  I just don't understand.\n\nDespite these two very irksome things, the staff overall is above average for a McDonald's.  The regular crew who work there in the morning are always friendly and pleasant (despite the fact that they keep asking me about eggs).  The people are the only reason I still go there."}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy this mcdonalds but today after not going to this location for more than a year, I received the worst customer service ever. Worst thing is that I think the man who disrespected me and made me feel unwelcome was the manager himself. Couldn't read his name tag or else I would have called the store owner because the service was completely rude. Never coming to this location ever again, which such a rude and racist manager."}
{"text":"Food was literally fast here, and truly fast unlike most fast food places these days.  Huge playground is nice as well.  Never thought I'd be praising a McDonald's attached to a gas station!"}
{"text":"It's inside the convenience store. So you do have to walk through. The staff was nice and quick but the play place was disgustingly filthy. It's been awhile since I've even been to a play place (cuz there's none around anymore) and maybe this is why, there was food in it and even one piece was covered in ants. There is only one bathroom (combined men's and women's).. Inside the play place! So while we were there two men used the restroom, gross especially near all the children!"}
{"text":"Embarrassing for the McDonald's brand.\nOther than the charming and conversational young man at the drive thru, this place needs a training overhaul.  I can tolerate the occasional screw up/missing item from my order.  I am willing to tolerate the occasional cold fries, and disappointing burger.  But this last trip thru the drive thru was absurd.  They asked me to pull forward and my food would be right out.  I waited and waited, and counted 20 cars drive around me until finally I called the store from my car.  They said, oh yes, we will bring it right out....  I waited another 6 minutes.  Start time to order a quater pounder combo....11:02.  Food arrival time... 11:23.  I got to my office .04 miles away, and my food was stone cold.\nI am at a loss to understand how the people responsible for the training at this place can accept a pay check for what they do.  This is NOT NASA people... it's a  McDonald's, and you're embarrassing yourselfs."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit here. Very friendly staff and pretty clean too. The food was good and you really can't complain about it."}
{"text":"Hey I'm not one to usually commend mcdonalds employees,  but you have a great crew here.  I have an order that most mcdonalds get wrong about 3/4 of the time,  these guys were flooded with drive thru traffic and still got my order 100% correct.  Also the kid at the front counter is very professional and so it seemed was the rest of the crew.  He put a smile on my face and you could tell he gave the work place a great energy.  I hope the owner reads this and gives them all a raise because they do a great job.  Best mcdonalds I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Um, it's a McDonald's.  Service is good.  Everything else is like any other McDonalds. Except this one is connected to a gas station.  Drive thru line can get pretty long sometimes."}
{"text":"Well, it is a McDonald's attached to a gas station so what can you expect.  \n\nFirst thing that irritated me with this place... the drive thru.  Sometimes, it is inconveniently closed during peak morning hours.  Why? I don't know.  I'm assuming they are understaffed.\n\nSecond, the bathroom is disgusting and unisex.  I won't let my poor daughter use it even if she is about to pop."}
{"text":"Just a regular old McDonalds. They have a play area for the kids that is separate from the main section. That helps keep the screaming to a minimal roar. There is also a gas station attached, so you can by other food and drinks but still be inside McDonalds. \n\nThe service is okay. Today the cashier was too busy on his phone texting to greet me promptly. When we received the order, we were given the wrong chicken nugget sauce.  Getting the order wrong is a normal occurrence at this location, so double check your food before you leave. \n\nI go every Friday with the kids after school for a treat. It helps them tire out when they play with the other kids. Bring your kids to play!"}
{"text":"This place was ridiculously slow tonight. I stopped for my yearly crave - the Shamrock Shake. To be honest, I have no idea why I love these, especially since I like REAL ice cream and shakes the old fashion way - but this minty green shakes have me hooked. My son also wanted one, but he wasn't quite sure he would like it so I asked if he could have a small taste of mine before they made his; however, they could not do that. Instead I had to buy my shake, move to the side while the order was rung through the POS and then filled and brought out to me. Once he decided if he liked it or wanted another flavor, we had to place another order and then pay for it.  I asked if I could just pay for a small shake and he would decide the flavor after he tasted my - NOPE. I was highly annoyed. I understand restaurant POS and the need to track inventory, but come on - it's a shake. Not only that ... it took over 10 minutes for 2 shakes and they weren't that busy. \n\nUnfortunately, I have been to this location on several times because it is close to the house. I typically don't eat the food, but my son loves McDonalds, so I stop for him. On numerous occasions they have messed up the order (he only eats plain burgers) and the service speed is extremely random, regardless of how busy they are. Sometimes it is awesome, other times it is horribly slow. \n\nI really don't like giving businesses a poor rating, but this last visit topped it off, and I had to share. I understand the machines are automated, but they could have rang up the shakes and then manually poored the correct flavor, it isn't rocket science, and it isn't going to through off their inventory!"}
{"text":"They say that you only remember bad things about experiences, well this is true of this McDonalds mostly because I've never had a good experience there. I'm not sure they do this at all McDonald's but they only put a half a slice of cheese on the filet of fish. When I asked for a full piece of cheese to cover the whole sandwich they wanted to charge me a dollar just for the cheese. I ordered a big breakfast this morning and it came with sausage. I don't like McDonald's sausage. I went to the manager and I asked her if I could have  bacon instead of sausage when I ordered the meal. She said yes you could have bacon instead. I asked her why didn't the cashier asked me if I wanted sausage or bacon. She replied that we don't offer a choice. I asked her where on the menu does it say I have a choice between sausage and bacon. She replied it doesn't say that anywhere on the menu. I asked her how am I supposed to know that I can switch out the sausage for bacon instead if I don't know that I can. And she repled we don't offer you that you have to know it. I also ordered coffee then I asked if I could get free refills and they tell me yes free refills. So I walked out the door with my coffee almost empty and I decided I wanted more coffee so instead of going back in the store I go through the drive thru and they tell me that I can't have a free refill. I don't know who owns this McDonalds but they're cheap ass owners."}
{"text":"My kid likes the playground there, workers are friendly, food is okay, My only criticism is it has a bit of a smell."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would! I just had a disappointing experience at McDonald's store #21224 here in Phoenix at 7:21pm. \n\nI was very excited to go to McDonalds as today is the first day that they started offering breakfast all day. I'm in love with the egg white delight!  So I stopped by after work and ordered one.  The cashier was as nice as could be.  She took my order and asked me to drive up to the last window to pay and get my food. So I did.\n\nAfter I paid for my food and the cashier at the drive thru started getting my order ready, the manager walked up to her and berated her for letting me order an egg white delight. The manager was so rude and in my view asked the cashier \"can you  not look up and read the board?\".  The cashier responded saying that she was sorry and the manger told her \"no, there is no sorry\".  \n\nThen the manager walked over to me at the window and said we don't offer egg white delight all day, only what's on the board.  She then said \"I don't know what to tell you, you need to pick something on the board.\"  \n\nNot only was this manager rude and condescending to her employee, but she was rude to me the customer. And, the manager never apologized to me for the mistake.  Yes the cashier did, but if this manager thought it was such a big deal then she should have also apologized to me for not being able to fill the order I had placed and already paid for!  \n\nWhat a great way to start off this new campaign--berate your employee and insult your customer!!   Way to go McDonalds!!!"}
{"text":"We were served breakfast at 7 am on July 1st. When we got our orange juices one was noticeably a lighter color and only filled 3/4 of the way. The girl had an attitude (breanna) when we asked to have it swapped out. We also were given a sandwich with cheese when specifically asked for no cheese. When they brought the sandwich back out it was still wrong."}
{"text":"Gotta give it to this McDonalds.  Their drive through line can get pretty long but the service is always fast."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing that I know this, but if you frequent this McDonald's enough, the staff actually takes the time to call you by name...pretty cool."}
{"text":"I just ordered food from there an hour ago. My fries were all stale and cold. They must have been old. They forgot to give me my drink. I've been trying to call them and their phones are busy. Worst McDonald's I have ever been too. I tried to be nice yesterday and compliment them since it was Christmas but I feel like it was a mistake."}
{"text":"Zero stars for this stupid ass location. The workers are uneducated, dumb fucks. Always getting my order wrong. The managers are lazy pieces of shits especially this \"manager\" named Chriselle or whatever. Looks like a damn mouse. She's so rude and uneducated, I don't even know why she's still employed. She \"acts\" like she's working like how many fucking times are you going to fix the damn ketchup packets ???!!!!! She yells at the employees even though she's the one not doing a THING ! I heard this isn't corporate owned that's why all these dumbass managers haven't gotten fired yet."}
{"text":"Everyone at this McDonalds need to be fired. A 45 minute wait in the drive through and after all that my juice was warm as if it had been sitting there that entire time and my order was wrong i ordered a regular sausage egg and cheese mc griddle meal it was wrongno cheese no egg you guys are terrible."}
{"text":"Management is very rude here, I bring my son every now and then to play  and have witnessed on several occasions the manager who is a female was extremley rude. I was shocked at her behavior. I still go there because its close to my house."}
{"text":"Seriously.. If I could give them zero stars, I would. This McDonald's does not even deserve ONE f'n star. We ordered two spicy chickens, two sausage mcmuffins, and a large fries. She gave us our food with no receipt. We drove off and I reached in the bag for fries, only to find SOGGY fries that weren't even warm, which were drenched in OIL. We go back through drive thru and tell her that our fries are soggy and drenched in oil, we would like a new batch, & she said ok drive thru. Two cars ahead of us, which was fine. We got to the window and she just handed us the bag of fries and shut the window quick. No \"sorry for giving you disgusting stale ass fries that were soaked in oil because we re-fried them for you\". We checked the fries before we left this time and they were fresh. We get home, I open up my sausage mcmuffin and it was drenched in oil. This is my very first time ever getting a sausage mcmuffin so oily you can squeeze enough out to fry an egg. Sausage mcmuffins are usually somewhat DRY because the muffins are TOASTED. I feel like they dropped these muffins in a tub of oil then threw it on the grill to toast. The spicy chicken had soggy ass lettuce and it was just straight up sloppy. Like yeah, it's McDonald's, I don't expect a fucking 5star gourmet looking burger, but make that shit presentable to where people will still have a damn appetite! Never going back to this McDonald's ever again. I hope the store manager reads all these reviews about their location. Disgusting food and No sort of customer service from these people they call workers."}
{"text":"They can't get the orders right.  I always have to double check my bag before leaving the drive thru. They're open late, but they have no lights on at night. Poor service. I'd rather go to Sonic's down the street.  This Mc Donald's needs improvement.  Bad"}
{"text":"Went there just to get coffee in the morning and the one thing I need in the morning COFFEE was apparently out of order."}
{"text":"When I walked in, I knew I could not stay to eat, because the lobby was over run by middle school students, shouting, running, throwing things!  Cursing (normal language now days). \nThe entire staff however were focused on a homeless woman who had taken her shoes off to warm her feet.  Swollen, it was obvious her feet were causing her great pain. Wrapped in a blanket, she sat quietly eating a burger.\nShe had been asked to leave. The staff was so focused, obviously disgusted by this woman, that I worried they forgot my order!  \nThe staff at this store did not see anything wrong with the brew-ha-ha going on with the middle school students 20+ people.  They had NO compassion for an elderly woman, trying to get warm.  I rarely go to this location anyway, ..... But never again."}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's ever bad costumer service cold burgers cold fries the manager lady is the biggest B**** I have meet,  the people that work there are slow and dumb I think I rather drive out of my way than come here."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would !!! They do not train staff in guest service and the management is horrible . When I am not near a Starbucks I like to come here sometimes for their iced coffee, they have never got my order right and never been compelled to fix my order or give me a refund . One day me and hubby were in a rush in the morning and grabbed \" breakfast \" when we got Into the car we look inside of our bag and we have all lunch items. We go back inside to correct our order and we are informed that breakfast is over and there is nothing they can do. They proceeded to take our name down and told us we could grab free breakfast the next day. Next morning comes around and we go to get our breakfast. We are told that our names are not in the book and again there's nothing they can do !? I mean it's mcdonalds but please have some pride in what you do!?"}
{"text":"I stopped at this McDonald's because I had about two minutes to grab lunch. The ONLY reason I ever eat at a Mickey D's is because it's a) fast, b) cheap and c) predictable. You know the food won't be awesome, but it will be reasonably eatable. Man, was I disappointed on points b) and c).\n\nFirst, the medium Quarter Pounder meal was more than six bucks. Jeez, that's hardly a deal.\n\nWhat made the sticker shock worse was the poor quality of the food. This had to be the worst Quarter Pounder I've ever (half) eaten. Maybe even the worst fast food burger I've ever had. It looked like it had been sitting out on Uncle Zeke's radiator all morning. The burger patties were gray and curled up at the edges. The bun was dry and crusty. It's like the damn thing was somehow mummified. Just nasty. Too bad I didn't have time to take it back.\n\nThis will probably be the very last time I ever eat at a McDonald's. It was that bad."}
{"text":"To the girl workin tonight. You didn't have to make my food so sloppy. sure I didn't know what I wanted, so it took me a while to order. But still.\n2 stars cause sometimes it isn't bad.\nDidn't get a receipt either  maybe so I don't do a bad survey?"}
{"text":"The worst service ever. And I'm not a rude person, at all. I said \"please\" and \"thank you.\" And I absolutely was not greeted whatsoever. Whoever that dumbass lady was, that was working needs to take that stick out of her. Don't be mad at me 'cause you hate YOUR job, bitch. Let's not forget that everyone is REPLACEABLE, including your miserable self. It took every bit of me not to cuss her out. I'd write a letter to corporate but she did not give me a receipt. Go figure right. I'm not one to talk down on people that works fast food because it's not in my character to knock someone's hustle. But she really needs to get it together. And for that, I will NOT ever return to this McDonald's ever again. Some bullshit. Oh. And. Not only did I not get a receipt... I didn't get a straw. And instead of 10 piece chicken nuggets, I got 9. What in the fucking fuck..... Fuck that McDonalds."}
{"text":"They have signs posted telling you that you are only allowed 30 minutes to consume your food and then you must vacate... that seems a bit pushy."}
{"text":"I would not like give them even 1 star ! I was been there 2 times before, I bought grill chicken wrap . \nI am always walk inside to get my Order, but they gave me the food so cold , not even a little bit hot, vegetables isn't fresh, look nasty, look like the old food, which you should throw it away, it could not eat! I was so mad, but I was leaving . I would not like  give them the complain, because I don't think I will be back. \nAnd then Yesterday after I got off work, I went back, because it's close my house, and I hope they already changed and updated the good service , but I think I guessed wrong, they have the same service , they are so rude and mean  with customer, \nI ordered  2 Oreo mc flurry ice cream ! A girl gave me the first ice cream and then \nI asked her \n\" how come you not use the machine for mix ice cream??\"\nshe said \" we don't have machine for mix\" \nI said \" why? \"\nAnd I saw the machine , \nI told her \" the machine was there, why you not use it and mix for me, before you guys always mix for me\" \nand then she had  bad attitude \nshe just said  \" no, no more \" \nand in the during time she made  for me the second ice cream , gave it for me, my cup not even full , I bought the large size for my ice  cream, but she didn't give me full cup,just show me her attitude , I am not happy at all, I just said \" thank you\"  and was leaving, I could  talk to manager right? But I would not like to do that for give them the trouble and make the problem, I just would  like enjoy my ice cream , that's make me happy, but the reason I write on here, I just let they know, what happen at their store Mc Donald's  and they should solve  their service . I am really dissatisfied  at all, I already gave them a chance . That's why I came back, but now, I think I never come back again!"}
{"text":"McDonald's be like, \"Here are 2 sauces for your 20 piece McNuggets\". Yeah.. Wrong sauces. Asked for Hot Mustard, Hot Mustard on receipt, Sweet and Sour in the bag. Also, fries were stale."}
{"text":"Worse Service and customer Service.\nWaited to order the food the receipt is correct this sticker on the box is correct the food is wrong .....how hard is it to read and follow directions it's not NASA its Mc Donald's"}
{"text":"I can't anymore. It's too busy here and service is not as fast as other Mickey D's with this kind of volume. Customers are rude too."}
{"text":"Worst service. The cashier was trying to make the mcflurry and knew it was running out of mix. Instead of just telling me we are low on mix she gave me half a cup! Never again."}
{"text":"Dirty and bug problems as well.\n\nLots of \"interesting\" people here. Some are work crews taking lunch, some appear to be working girls, taking a break.\n\nI've seen the gamut during the few times I've dropped in here."}
{"text":"Typical McDonald's food, their $1 menu is more expensive than my regular stops. Their breakfast burritos are $1.19, not $1 like most McD's are. So if you don't mind higher prices, or the people walking around asking for change to buy a sandwich, this place is fine."}
{"text":"So it was rainy and I decided to eat my feelings. Nothing works better than a 2 cheeseburger meal for that.  Burgers could have been warmer but fries were outstanding. Drive thru is that new double configuration that's really annoying but I'm sure it's less so at off peak times. Girl at the window was efficient and nice."}

{"text":"Insgesamt sehr schwache Leistung. Es geht damit los, dass die Parkpl√§tze nicht ausreichen und diverse Wildparker einen am Wieder-Wegfahren hindern. Auch die Sitzpl√§tze im Lokal sind knapp bemessen. \nEssen: Man m√∂chte meinen, dass man bei einem standardisierten Burger nicht sooo viel falsch machen kann. Kann man jedoch durchaus, wenn man es nicht schafft, die Zutaten auf- statt nebeneinander zu schichten, sodass man erstmal selbst neu zusammensetzen darf und dabei leider auf den K√§se, der unwideruflich in der Schachtel festklebt, verzichten muss. Auch nicht gut: Den Wrap falschrum in die Schachtel zu setzen, so dass man oben kaut, w√§hrend sich die F√ºllung durch das unten offene Ende verabschiedet. Kalt ist es zudem auch √∂fters mal.\nPersonal: Zun√§chst mal gibt es hier schlicht zuwenig davon. Man sieht die Leutchen an der Ausgabe durchaus wuseln, trotzdem kann es vorkommen, dass man 30 Minuten in der Warteschlange verbringt  was den Begriff Fast Food dann schon ein bisschen ad absurdum f√ºhrt. \nAnsonsten muss man wissen, an wen man sich wenden kann und um wessen Kasse man besser einen weitr√§umigen Bogen macht, weil da grunds√§tzlich nie das in der T√ºte/ auf dem Tablett landet, was man auch bestellt hat und tendenziell die H√§lfte fehlt. Es ist sinnvoll, den Leutchen ganz genau auf die Finger zu gucken, damit man sofort reklamieren kann, wenn das ohne Eis mal wieder ignoriert wird und der Chickenburger ohne TS daherkommt. \nUnd nein: Es ist nicht sonderlich clever, erst die Pommes aufs Tablett zu r√§umen und dann zehn Minuten auf den Burger zu warten. Bis dahin sind die Pommes n√§mlich kalt. Und solche Fehler lie√üen sich wirklich leicht vermeiden. \nEs gibt r√ºhmliche, schnelle und freundliche Ausnahmen, die positiv auffallen.

{"text":"I work in the area and wanted to buy my staff some breakfast.  I don't go to Mc Donalds often, as I am not a huge fan of their food, but it was the closest fast food establishment to my work - so Mc Donalds it is!\n\nI ordered 2 Big Breakfasts with Hot Cakes on one order and another Big Breakfast with Hot Cakes on a separate order (two different payments).  I pulled up to the window and was told to pull around the parking space #1.  I told the cashier, \"Ok.  Just remember I have two SEPARATE orders.\"  She looked at me confused, smirked, and said she didn't understand with a giggle A.K.A. she didn't know English.  I smiled and trusted they would know what to do and pulled around.\n\nA few minutes later (I did not have to wait very long) another lady came up to my window with one of my orders.  I explained to her that I had two separate orders.  She told me, she didn't speak English.  At this point I am now becoming annoyed.  So I get out of the car, lock it up, and walk into the restaurant.  I go up to the cashier (third person at this point) and started to explain that I had two separate orders.  She looked at me confused and then called her manager over, as she did not speak English either.  The young girl, the supervisor on duty, asked me what the problem was.  So I explained to her that I have two separate orders and I am missing one of my orders.  She then tells me that I only paid for 2 orders.  I told her NO that I have two separate orders and I paid for both of them separately (and have the receipts for each of them).  She looks annoyed, walks back over to the window, where my order was sitting, grabs it, and hands it to me pissed off... as thought it was somehow MY fault?  No apologies offered.  Only COLD food.  At that point, I walk out without saying a word.  Annoyed.  Pissed.  But I just wanted to go back to work.  I only ended up eating a hashbrown, the sausage, and that's it.  The eggs were set, slimy, and COLD.  The pancakes were COLD.  The biscuit was hard.  I basically threw money in the toilet.  \n\nI did leave a review with Mc Donalds (as instructed on their receipts) but I fulled expect no response, as we all know Mc Donalds does not care much about their customers.  That is why I stopped going a long time ago.  They could learn from places like In and Out and Chick-Fil-A which truly value their customers feedback and train their employees how to treat customers."}
{"text":"I'm not really feeling like writing a review. It's  really more like a tip. But anyway, more than most McDonalds, this one is consistent with portion size. They also are friendly which is a plus compared to most fast food joints."}
{"text":"It's McDonald's so you can't really expect the best the best. But this has by far been the worse McDonald's I have ever been to. For as long as it took to get a McDouble after ordering I could have gone to a sit down restaurant order and probably get my food way quicker. I always try to understand the situations that happen in Restaurants because I myself at one point in my life worked at McDonald's but this was the worse experience. They had a bunch of employees working but yet no one was working. I spotted employees eating behind the counter even a manager took some French fries and put them in her mouth as she passed the lines of people waiting for food and to have their order taken. All those kids working there need to be fired and replaced with people that actually want to work. Yeah working at McDonald's isn't the best job but if that's what you applied for and then do your damn job!! Never will I ever go back to this specific McDonald's again. This was not the first bad experience here but this was by far the worse one that it made me want to write a bad review. Whoever owns this McDonald's needs to really get their staff in check!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible!\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am a fan of McDonalds. My Mom actually worked for them as a the pubic relations director for a large franchise owner in the Midwest. However, this also means I know a McDs should be run when it comes to customer service.\n\nI was driving by this location. It is newer location design and I had a coupon, so I swung in to try out their new sandwich. It was early afternoon and there was no line. After placing the order I saw the total was wrong.  The total was not the coupons price or the regular price with tax. I mentioned this to the register person, and she said she had to get her manager to fix the total. It happens sometimes, I understand that. However, when the manager came over, she cleared the charge on my card, handed me back the coupon and basically said 'go away'... \n\nWow...\n\nI was shocked and left.  The feeling I was left with was so sour, it led me to go online and fill out the McDs customer survey.\n\nIn hindsight, it does not sound like much, but it was more of her attitude that left me dumfounded. The \"I don't care about your satisfaction as a customer or as a person\" attitude. I also understand that this is in a lower income area of Phoenix. However, I was dressed in business casual attire and was friendly to them.\n\nThe manager needs to be demoted or sent back to training. \nReading the other profile shows how much the poor attitude of a manager can create an workforce where no employee cares.\n\nI will never visit this location again."}
{"text":"The cashier was the only good part of it. They forgot so many things that I ordered and trying to charge me for more for stupid syrup omg."}
{"text":"I walk in, order my food, slide my card, and the cashier gives me a confused look. She then says to me, as though it should have been obvious, \"it's cash only.\"  The only reason I go to a place like McDonalds is for a consistent experience, and one of those consistencies is usually that I know I can pay with a card. It's 2015. If you don't accept cash, you need to put up a sign and let your customers know."}
{"text":"For a fast food restaurant.... I have never been more impressed before. I love how they greet you and their personality. I almost I forget I'm at McDonald. They definitely remind me of Chic Fil La. I wish more McDonald's were like them!"}
{"text":"The configuration for their entrance and parking lot seems to be designed to keep people out.\n\nIf you have a lot of time and patience to invest in getting into the place I'm sure the food is what you would expect at McDonald's"}
{"text":"I enjoy going to this McDonalds as it is the best in the Huntersville. I order from the kiosk and the burgers are very good."}
{"text":"The franchise owner of this location should hurry to get this store under control.  Management is horrible!  Service is horrible.  Took my kids there three times hoping things would improve.  Ordered a McFlurry.  Took three times to get it right.  The first was wrong flavor, second was with a hole in the bottom of cup with ice cream falling out....  Third time was with the employee using the \"N\" word in front of my to kids!\n\nRight now this McDonalds is a joke!"}
{"text":"I was expecting this location to be a lot nicer than it was since it is brand new. The floors were dirty & so were the tables. They messed up my order & I had to ask them to fix it after they ignored me for a while. They have touch screen games for kids. They were dirty & already broken, the screen was cracked & didn't work. The corner farthest away from the front of the store had at least 5 or 6 employees hanging out, laughing being loud and cursing. From what I saw someone should be cleaning the place instead of hanging out."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally rate a McDonalds, but this establishment, and the employees deserve kudos.  They are always fast through the drive through, and always courteous.  Nice, friendly employees!"}
{"text":"A beautiful new store, in a great location near WalMart and the car dealership megaplex. This store has the self service order kiosks, which will come in handy because they only have 3 registers. The seating ranges from spinning stools to some strange looking patio type chairs and if course the traditional booths. \n\nThe one thing that stood out to me was the menu board. When you step up to the registers, the menu is only a couple of feet away. It's very well lit, and I didn't need my glasses to read it. \n\nHopefully this McDonald's will be maintained and stay clean. Between the neighboring high school and the WalMart, it's going to take some work to keep it looking as nice as it does now."}
{"text":"Horrible experience last night!  The management at this McDonald's needs to improve their employee training.  At least 20 young employees standing around laughing including the managers and ignoring the customers.  So why did it take 30+ minutes to get 2 apple pies that they told me would only take 6 minutes?  And their ice cream machine was down.  Brand new McDonald's and their equipment is already breaking down?  It's a bad sign.  Just go to a Chick-fil-a (any Chick-fil-a) and see the drastic difference in quality of food and customer service.  Needless to say, won't be going back to this McDonald's."}
{"text":"Wanted to write a positive review for an \"almost\" fine dining experience!  Yes, I realize I was at McDonald's! \n\nI had the pleasure of having the Create Your Taste experience at this location, and it was phenomenal!  Upon entering the restaurant, you are able to build your own burger at their touch screen kiosks. This is only the beginning of the dining experience where you are able to select the type of meat you would like for your sandwich and a vast assortment of various accompaniments, including bacon.  My burger was extremely well well-dressed...  I chose the quarter-pound beef patty on Artisan roll with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, bacon ($1.00 upcharge), pepper jack cheese, American cheese, guacamole, Mac sauce, crispy fried onions, and leaf lettuce. I also asked for the parmesan peppercorn sauce and creamy garlic sauce on the side to sample and to dip my fries  Once my order was placed, I had the option to pay at the kiosk or at the cash register.  I chose to pay atthe cash register so that I could confirm that my order was correct.  When the order was confirmed, I was given a hand-held locator and asked to be seated. The locator was used by the staff to find me in the dining area, and to bring the food to me once it was prepared.  I'm sorry, did I mention it's a McDonalds?\n\nMy wait was about 7 minutes, but for good reason!  I simply thought this would be a regular quarter pounder with cheese to which they would add all of my requests, but nooooo!  Your sandwich is prepared fresh to order, there is no pre-cooked meat, and it's dressed according to your specific taste.  My burger arrived wrapped in sandwich paper and my fries were in sandwhich paper inside of its own personal fry basket.  How very cute!  My burger was delicious and not overly messy... even with my grocery list of toppings.\n\nThe service was excellent!  My entire meal was $8.32 and well worth the extra cost, even at a fast food restaurant. I must say it was ONE OF THE BEST BURGERS I have ever had!  And since I received such a surprisingly excellent dining experience, I went to speak with the manager.  I wanted to compliment chef Cameron who prepared my burger, as well as the staff who assisted. The dining area was quite clean and I enjoyed my time at this very new and phenomenal McDonald's!!"}
{"text":"I'm done with this place. They broke my heart twice. No more hot mustard sauce. No more cinnimelts. I have nothing else I want to eat there. Going to Wendy's"}
{"text":"I think most of us have certain expectations of any restaurant. My experience with this location has poisoned me against all McDonald's. It started when my wife said she wanted a fruit smoothy. We ordered our smoothies which came to $8 for 2 larges. Cool fun thing to do right...\n\nThe next day I saw my card had been double charged. So I went back and asked the manager if she could make it right. I said I didn't even need a cash refund it would have been fine to just take it off the order I was about to make. She said she could not do that and that she had no way to look it up. She gave me a phone number to their office in Mentor. I called the person in Mentor who looked up my order she said I needed to wait 10 days or so because the card had been authorized but not charged twice. \n\n10 days later the charge came off but I expect when I go out for food my card will not be double authorized. Be that as it may $8 worth of food would have fixed this. I will NEVER go back to McDonald's because of how this was handled."}
{"text":"I go here and always have a big order and they get it right every time great love the new two car drive threw it speeds things up and the inside is very clean"}
{"text":"I am mad they sell you 20 mc nuggets meal and limit you on the amount of sauce!  What a rip off I recommend Wendy s better price and taste!  Shame on them and if you insist on more sauce they charge hope they go broke"}
{"text":"Slowest service. I keep trying thinking it has to get better and I end up kicking myself every single time."}
{"text":"You forget how lucky you are until you try other places. \n\nThis MCD went through a Renovation a couple years ago and still looks brand new inside. They have the coolest decor, it is all Americana. \n\nThe service is usually quick and I cannot recall a recent time where something was screwed up. Seriously That deserves 5 stars now-a days. \n\nNo play land... yeah! \nDouble drive through ... Yeah! \nCoffee thing with all the special stuff.... Yeah! \n\noh and the occasional crack head... viewing pleasure i guess."}
{"text":"As an A-rab man I found this McDonald's extremely offensive. Yes, they had excellent food and a smoking hot server, but there were monuments to the destructive acts of the American military all over the place. May as well have called it the shrine of destruction instead of McDonalds. Safe to say I won't be visiting this war memorial anytime soon"}
{"text":"I really don't understand this McDonald's... This is the closest McDonald's to my house without having to get out of my car at Walmart... But let me tell you!! Probably one of the worst McDonald's I've ever been to as far as customer service and overall service.. They're never on time, my fries are always weak and if I order a large they never give me a large serving.. Always a medium serving in a large container... Its safe to say I'll be using the Walmart McDonald's or take the extended drive to another location.."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE WORST MC DONALDS I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!!!  We live 2 miles from this mc donalds and have 4 kids that LOVE mc donalds so on busy days, after work, my boyfriend and/or I would drive thru this mc donalds often.  typically once a week. After having an issue every single time over a 3 month period, we finally started driving out of the way and going to a different location. While driving home today the kids saw this location and asked for mc donalds so, against our better judgement, we decided to give it another try.  Bad choice! The fries were cold and stale, as usual. And we were missing large fries. My boyfriend and I are both in the hospitality industry so we always try to see both sides and rarely complain. But we decided we had to say something  . So my boyfriend called and talked to the manager on duty and just explained our past experiences and how we gave them another try but that it was very dissapointing. He didn't catch the managers name the first time so I called back to ask and there were 2, Lisa and Melissa. The conversation he had with them is the absolute worst part of any experience we have ever had at the location. She was beyond extremely rude and showed no concern that we said we would not be back. She didn't offer to fix the problem nor did she car AT ALL. Again, we are in the industry but this is completely unacceptable. They deserve negative stars."}
{"text":"THE WORST MCDONALDS IN PHOENIX, THIS MCDONALDS SHOULD BE shut down and closed.  THERE ARE FLIES EVERYWHERE, all over walls, kitchen, counter, tables,  they are on the food, food not cooked well at here at all.   HOMELESS TRANSIENTS  follow you in the bathrooms, and, the HOMELESS take baths in the sinks, sleep outside and hang around.  THIS is near a horse track, and should not have been built\nat all."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through at 1:15 am and drove away with my food at 1:50 am, no joke. It would have been faster to park and walk into the Walmart McDonald's."}
{"text":"Im quite confident my 10 year old could've provided better customer service than I received tonight. \nSoda was on the outside of all my drinks, they werent wiped clean nor were napkins offered. I went to ask for napkins just as he gave me my order but of course he slammed the window shut & walked away. \nThanks...for shitty service."}
{"text":"I have been in the drive thru for 30 fucking minutes and I'm stuck because there are cars In front and behind me. This is unacceptable"}
{"text":"Very slow service. Nice people, but nothing to write home about. I stopped coming here, even for dollar drinks in the drive thru because of all the people who hang out in front of the restaurant, asking for things. Not bashing those on hard times, but also not wanting to be asked for my money when I'm on my short lunch hour from work."}
{"text":"1. Very poor service. \n2. Very dirty.\n3. Bathrooms are disgusting.\n4. Homeless people. \n5. Very slow drive thru. \n6. Don't bother unless you like to torture yourself."}
{"text":"I goto McD's twice a year. Shamrock shake and McRib. This year I added a 3rd trip during the BOGO offer for the new Quarter Pounders.\n\nDrive thru here offers two lanes to order that converge into one for pickup. Drivers beware. Many drivers leaving the DriveThru also U-turn into the parking area on the East side, so it's probably not a great place to park - and you take your life into your hands if you are trying to leave the Wal-mart via that passageway.\n\nWe found the new habanero QP to be fairly tasty, with a giant slice of tomato and the sauce was actually decent, with some spice to it. Not hot, but hotter than I expected from McD. I was gonna give them 3 stars for the fact that I was pleasantly sursprised.\n\nThen, I remembered that my previous trip here they didn't have shamrock shakes. They were out. Like 3 days into the limited time promotion. Back to two stars."}
{"text":"This is the McDonald's on the corner of 19th ave and Bell Rd. \nEven remodeled, it still looks dirty. It has always looked dirty in the 10 years I have driven past it and occasionally gone inside. There are always some sketchy looking characters loitering around too.\n It's right next to and across from some of the busiest bus stops in town, so it does have the convenience factor.\nThe last time I got a Big Mac and fries, it was not fresh.\nI never thought I would say this, but if you want a better McDonald's, just go into Wal-Mart right behind and try their McDonald's."}
{"text":"Worst McDonalds ever. I literally just sat in the drive through for 35 minutes. I couldn't get out because of the median and cars in front and behind me. I just watched a man in a pick-up.. Drive over the median and leave. People are turning off their cars in the drive through as well. I'd give no stars if I could."}
{"text":"Poor service sucks drive thru isn't better screwed my order up second time won't be back"}
{"text":"As far as a McDonald's this close to a Wal-Mart goes. I was actually kind of impressed with how well kept it was. Comparatively speaking...\n\nI had some time to kill before an appointment so I sat down with my laptop and had a coffee. There were tables with power outlets available specifically for customer use and the free wifi was nice.\n\nThis is McDonald's we're talking about here. They get 4 stars because my expectations were very low and they actually managed to impress me quite a bit during my short visit."}
{"text":"Never have anything i order they always say they ran out. Besides the rude customer service"}
{"text":"ALWAYS NORMALLY COME. Here TO THIS MCDONALD'S WITH NO PROBLEMS \nWell I ordered and they were not even busyyyyyy half of the team siting around talking while one of person makes food talking about your personal life and making one person work and took them 30 mins to get my order \nI work in customer service and never seen something like thatl and they need to watch there mouth around customers as well will never be coming back to store"}
{"text":"This mcdonalds horrible service is horrible food is nasty the wait is long and the employees are dumb and rude. It makes me not want to eat at any mcdonalds anymore! I just wanted an ice cream but the machine isnt working wow -.- if i could i would put negative 1 mil starts"}
{"text":"**Be sure to check your order before you leave this McDonald's. It's always missing some food item.**\n\nThis has happened to me 6 different times over the past 4 months. Why didn't I learn my lesson after the first time? It's not something you normally think about when you're in the drive thru, that \"Oh yeah this is the one that ALWAYS leaves something out!\" Plus, I've had other family members go get my order and forgot to warn them. It won't happen again because I'll never go back or send anyone else there.\n\nWhen I call the manager , he's always apologetic and says he'll replace the missing item but that's always a big inconvenience. Who wants to drive all the way back?\n\nThe only reason I gave it two stars is because it's the only McDonald's up in North Phoenix that has the game pieces throughout the entire Monopoly Game season. Other McDonald's run out the first few days or the first week. I guess this is the only McDonald's that doesn't let employees pilfer the pieces."}
{"text":"Never fails. One car in front me in the drive thru. I've been waiting 11 minutes. 11 FUCKING minutes. This is a joke right?!"}
{"text":"SO SLOW!!!!! Seriously I shouldn't  have to wait at the drive thru for 15 minutes before somebody asks to take my order. Absolutely ridiculous!!! This has happened multiple times and pissed me off to the point where I feel the need to write a review. AVOID THIS LOCATION! ZERO STARS!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been staying away from junk food for quite awhile but I cave sometimes. I'm at Walmart and decided to get a burger. God is punishing me for it cuz this one is apparently run by apes that don't comprehend as well as normal apes. Dude called my order number and then some other customer complained that he hadn't gotten his yet and so they took mine and threw it away to make the other guys... I watched this take place with my own eyes. WTF??? \n\nSTAY AWAY!!!\n\nUPDATE: someone there that I think was a shift supervisor or something apparently came in and started taking care of everyone's messed up orders. She was apologetic and gave me coupons for free McDonald's and also offered free french fries on the spot as well as a large drink. I declined the fries and a soda and I gave my coupons to strangers that were getting ready to order. The service here was so terrible that I gave free stuff away because I did not want anything to do with McDonald's! Usually I will bump up my review a star if they make an attempt to rectify... But it was so bad here I can't even do that."}
{"text":"Came in at 1015 they served me lunch even though it didn't start until 1030. However the bathrooms were disgusting, an employee walked out after using the restroom and did nothing about it knowing it was dirty."}
{"text":"I really don't like McDonalds in general. But in a moment of weakness, I stopped here in the middle of a long road trip. The kids were hungry and tired and we didn't want to spend any time driving around, looking for food. I wish we had looked a little more.\n\nWe had an awful experience. Not only was the place very dirty, but the food was terrible. The chicken sandwiches we got were very dry and tasted like some cleaning product that should have been rinsed off the grill. The fries were cold and withered.\n\nThis was my first visit to McD in at least 5 years. It will be at least that long before I try McD again."}
{"text":"Worst McDonalds in Vegas! Bad service consistently and sloppy made food. 3 trys and still crap. WTF! I am sure the hobo's panhandling outside could do better. They seriously must go out of the way to fuck things up. I just want to know what other McDonalds this Franchisee owns so I can avoid those also."}
{"text":"So after looking at some reviews I could say improvements were made. I wanted something from the Lunch Menu and I asked. The person taking my order goes sure but its about a 10 min wait. Caught me off guard. I really appreciate when a company/ business will go out of their way for the customer. Most McDonalds would have said: \"Sorry breakfast only until 10:30 am.\""}
{"text":"Had to use the drive thru, because I was on a road trip with my puppies, and it is just too darn hot in NV to leave them in the car for any reason.  That said, I got an iced coffee and some fries, as that was all I could find on the menu that was vegetarian.  Now I remember why I don't go here.  Then I realized, if I could have only found a Taco Bell, I could have had real food!"}
{"text":"No ice. Half of the soft drinks are out. Tables are filthy. Bathroom is limited function. Staff is courteous as they apologize!"}
{"text":"Status upon arrival: Hungover, Starving, Filthy, 3 hours of sleep.\n\nEven though McDonalds is known to be fast food as in fast service, we love to request our Angus burgers fresh upon order. (waiting the extra 10 minutes) Okay, so we starved more than we had to, but finally after receiving our food, the first thing my cousin noticed was how old the patties were. Little did they know my cousin worked at McD's for over two years.\n\nIf your going to give us crap anyways, give a lame excuse instead of having your customers starve for no reason. This branch definitely failed to meet our hunger satisfaction."}
{"text":"I bought a filet-o-fish and asked for a large cup of ice. They charged me $1 for a cup of ice...fail!"}
{"text":"This is the worse McDonalds ever. How does this place every time I come here get my order wrong. How hard is it to make two plain cheeseburgers plain meaning Meat, Cheese, and Bun. I'll never come to this one again in my lifetime and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"Horrible Service- to the extent that I had to come on and write about a mcdonalds... Lol"}
{"text":"7/12/14 @12:15 had lunch here! Everyone & everything was on point. I've had so many bad experiences at Mc Donalds but for these guys I decided to make a yelp account just for this! Chicken nuggets and fries were perfectly crispy and the whole drive through crew was amazingly nice and they got our order right which is a gigantic plus in my book. Thanks for making our stay in Vegas even better! Going again today! Hehehe"}
{"text":"Agree, worst McDonalds ever. Not only did they mess up our order, they messed up the order before ours."}
{"text":"The worst mc Donald's in Las Vegas trust me I love here. I been there many times because I use to go to school down the street from there and every single time, every single time, they gave me the wrong order or didn't give me my drink or had to wait 20 minutes for my order. To make it worst the drive thru is not fast by any means either, ur looking at at least 15 minutes over the limit. It's on a busy location but they don't seem to care because the place is always dirty, napkins on the floor and ketchup all over the tables; to make it worse the restrooms are disgusting. If you are hungry don't go here at all, at all!!! No customer service and dirty as hell location"}
{"text":"Hands down worst McDonald's we've ever visited. Fairly nice employees, but:\n- slow service: the place was almost empty, but it took nearly 20 minutes to get our food\n- low quality ingredients: my prepackaged side salad was filled with wilted iceberg and dry carrot shavings\n- inconvenient: you have to ask for them to unlock the bathrooms, and you have to show a receipt for refills\n- poor service: they were \"out\" of water cups (even though they just gave one to the guy before me), and wouldn't give me something else for water instead"}
{"text":"It was one of the first in the North York area to upgrade to the McCaf√© d√©cor, with a dining area decked out with flat screen TVs and nice chairs. However, due to the high turnover at this restaurant, the service isn't always the greatest. Nevertheless, I have never really had a bad experience at this location."}
{"text":"I ordered a Big Mac combo and a cheese burger. They gave me a soggy wrap. \nMaybe it's because I went through the drive through after midnight. \nIf you do go be sure to check your order. This place is notorious for their order screw ups."}
{"text":"So gross. Its always littered with loud mouthed teenagers, service is rude and slow and Ive found hair in my food more than once."}
{"text":"The service is crap here today for some reason. I went to the drive-thru today, boy was I treated rudely. No smile and no smile, it's like get your sh*t and get the hell out!\n\nThis is the only McDs here in my area, if there's another one close by, I would happily go there!\n\nWill we come back?  Sad to say we will."}
{"text":"Not that McDonalds is ever a good place to eat, but this location is consistently terrible. It just so happens to be close to my home so if I'm on my way home and need something quick, I will stop at the drive through and every time, I wonder why I bothered. Slowest service ever, like even in the middle of the night it takes 20 min to get through. The teens taking your order are full of attitide, say \"uh huh\", \"what else\" and have no manners. When you get to the window there is typically one person actually working and 5 others goofing around and being loud and obnoxious. I mean. Not that I ever expect much from a fast food place, let alone a McDonalds, this place takes the cake for exceptionally poor service. Perhaps hire a manager who is out of highschool?"}
{"text":"OK so I said it was clean... That's on a superficial level... BATHROOMS ARE GROOOOOOSSSSS!!!!!\n\n\nAnd i MUST Add.. There's a Lady named Mary working here...  She is the sweetest lady... Very friendly with my kids!"}
{"text":"I don't normally review fast food chains, but I must voice my concern. \n\nIs McDonalds modifying the menu?  Going exotic perhaps? I got drive thru breakfast this morning and brought it home for my wife and I.  In the mist of her biting into her hashbrown a small speck fell off.  Upon closer examination it was an ant or a wasp that was deep fried!  Oh McDonalds, I thought your quality control and restaurant cleanliness was top priority."}
{"text":"Der schlechteste McDonalds den ich gesehen habe. Die Damen an der Kasse k√∂nnen nicht einmal deutsch sprechen. Wenn ich mir nen Cheesburger ohne Gurken bestelle werden sie sauer und sagen das w√ºrde sehr lange dauern. Der ganze Aufbau des \"Restaurants\" ist total schlecht. Um an die Tische zu kommen muss man durch die wartende Menge. Und wenn man an den Tischen ankommt die n√§chste √úberraschung, schmutzige Tische √ºberall Fliegen.

Die Kasse bem√ºht sich m√∂glichst flott die G√§ste zu bedienen aber das funktioniert noch nicht so routiniert wie in anderen L√§den der Kette.\n\n\n Aber die absolute Hammer ist das Marktstation-Interne Toilettenstation. Hier lungert eine Klodame ganz besonderer Art herum, die es tats√§chlich schafft einem die Lust an der Notdurft g√§nzlich zu vermiesen, wenn sie mit ihrer unfreundlichen Art einen ermahnt doch sofort Geld in ihre Schale zu werfen. Zum einen bezahlt man ja in der Regel immer erst dann wenn man das stille √ñrtchen am verlassen ist, da man ja auch da erst sich ein Bild machen konnte mit welchem Angagement die Klopolizei dieses in Ordnung gehalten hat, und zum zweiten l√§sst man sich ja ungern dazu zwingen. Abgesehen von der Behandlung ist die Toilette von der reinheit her aber tats√§chlich keinen Cent wert, da es hier nach allem riecht nur nicht nach Putzmittel.\n\n\n F√ºr Reisende, die vor der Abfahrt ihres Zuges noch schnell einen Imbiss zu sich nehmen wollen rate ich dringend vor ienem Besuch des Mc Donalds hier am Bahnhof ab, da es nur zu stresigen Erlebnissen f√ºhrt."}

Der Big M√§c meiner Begleitung war zwar so lala, aber zu meinem Mc Rib gab s blo√ü 2,3 Zwiebelw√ºrfel, vor allem aber schmeckte die So√üe komischerweise deutlich nach Zimt: wom√∂glich aber nur, weil sie schon ziemlich z√§hfl√ºssig angetrocknet war, wie das ganze Teil blo√ü lauwarm ankam = definitiv stand es schon l√§nger rum! \nAn \"unserer\" Warteschlange musste der Mitarbeiter (von 5 Bestellannahmen nur 3 besetzt) ausgerechnet auch noch Pommes frites f√ºr die anderen 2 Bestellannahmen mitmachen, daher hie√ü es nach jeder abgewickelten Bestellung: \"Moment bitte\"! Zudem sprach er derma√üen schlecht deutsch, dass er \"Mc Wrap\" statt \"Mc Rib\" verstand. \"Mc Wrap\" hatte er aber schon in die Kasse getippt und da der 20 Cent teurer ist als mein bestellter \"Mc Rib\", musste er erst seinen besser deutschsprachigen Kollegen aus der K√ºche holen, der dann erkl√§rte, dass die 20 Cent aus der Kasse nicht ausgebucht werden k√∂nnen - Nach der (genauso 20 Min.) Wartezeit hab ich Mc Donalds die 20 Cent dann sozusagen \"gespendet\". Aber abgesehen von mangelhafter Qualit√§t: wieso steht diese Filiale eigentlich f√ºr \"Fast food\", wenn dort nur im \"Schneckentempo\" gearbeitet wird?\nWenn ich das n√§chste Mal aus der Not dort aufschlage, gibt's hoffentlich erstmals einen besseren Mc Donald-P√§chter..."}

{"text":"Das Personal des McCaf√© war definitiv mit grundlegenden Aufgaben √ºberfordert. Das Sortiment war nicht bekannt und ein Cappuccino dauerte definitiv doppelt so lange wie in anderen Mc Caf√©s. Die Bagel lagen augenscheinlich schon l√§ngere Zeit fertig in der K√ºhlung. Das nachtr√§gliche Aufw√§rmen gab dann den zusammengefallenen Salatschnipseln den Rest."}

Dann will ich auch wie ein Kunde behandelt werden und nicht noch daf√ºr bezahlen, mich wie Dreck behandeln zu lassen!  Dieser Mc ein ganz Hartes St√ºck"}
{"text":"letzter Besuch im Jahr 2005 bei McDonalds am Stuttgart Hbf:\n\n\n Einrichtung: die Theke ist sehr mickrig bis d√ºnn! Daf√ºr sind die Sitzpl√§tze eher magerer. Oh Gott eine lange Warteschlange! 1 Punkt!\n\n\n Service: Nach endlich langer Warteschlange von 20 Minuten stand ich vor der Mitarbeiterin. Doch! Hey! Wohin schaute sie denn? Zu mir!? NEIN! Zu dem Herren dahinten, wo er eigentlich noch NICHT dran gekommen sein sollte! Erstes Ignorieren! 15 Minuten warten! Der Herr hat seine Bestellung bekommen & tsch√ºss! Und schaute sie mich nun an? NEIN! Ich wurde ein zweites Mal ignoriert! Ein Gruppe Jugendliche hinter mir bestellten eine gro√üe Ladung! Toll, warten, warten, warten! 20 Minuten vergangen! Die Gruppe hat ihr Essen bekommen & tsch√ºss! Ich blickte sie richtig zornig an & sie hat meinen K√∂der angebissen! Auf die Frage, ob sie mich gesehen hat, BEJAHTE sie! Den Grund wollte sie mir sagen & fragen, ob ich eine Bestellung aufgegeben habe. Hallo!? Spinnte sie √ºberhaupt? Erstens habe ich noch nicht bestellt & zweitens kam die Frage erheblich zu sp√§t, nachdem ich beim ersten Mal ignoriert wurde. Die unversch√§mte Absicht kostete immens an Punkten! Ich bestellte zwei McChicken, wortkarg machte sie an ihre Arbeit. Auf die Uhr blickte ich, dass mein BR403-Zug, der als InterCityExpress nach Dortmund f√§hrt, sich von mir verabschiedet hat. Nachdem der Zug aus dem Bahnhof verschwand, ist auch das Essen angekommen! Das war nichts! Ein Punkt!\n\n\n Ambiente: Nachdem ich das Essen bekommen hatte, suchte ich verzweifelt nach einem Sitzplatz! Ich sah einen Sitzplatz, aber auf dem Tisch Essensreste, auf dem Boden noch frischen Ketchup, auf der Bank herrschte N√§sse! Die Sitze sahen eher etwas sauber aus & da sa√ü ich UNGEM√úTLICH & a√ü mein Essen...Ein Punkt f√ºr dieses unhygienisches Ambiente!\n\n\n Essen: 2 McChickens, beide ungew√ºrzt, Salat labbrig. H√∂chstens der Chicken & die Burger waren i. O. Zwei Punkte!\n\n\n Preis: F√ºr diese hohe Preise gegen das entt√§uschende Essen gebe ich ein Punkt!\n\n\n Mein Fazit: Der McDonalds am Hauptbahnhof hat sehr viele, sehr sehr viele Kundschaft. Mein Eindruck:\n- stocksauer\n- entt√§uscht\n- nicht wohl gef√ºhlt\n- \"dreckig\" ist das mindeste Wort. Man sollte das Veterin√§ramt holen!\n- unn√∂tig Geld ausgegeben\nK√ºnftig werde ich diesen Laden nicht nur dies vergessen, sondern alles vergessen, als h√§tte der Laden gar nicht existiert! Zug verpasst, lange Wartezeiten, vors√§tzliche Doppelignoranz durch die dreiste Mitarbeiterin & Essen zu mager! One Time and never again, mit anderen Worten: Ich ignoriere dich f√ºr immer!"}
{"text":"Also einen McDonald's zu bewerten ist normalerweise nicht mein Ding, aber DIESER muss ich nun kritisieren. Ich wurde sp√§t abends dort abgeholt und habe dann noch was dort essen wollen. Es war kurz vor Ladenschluss, aber wir haben uns noch hingesetzt. Pl√∂tzlich wurden wir von einer Bedienung derma√üen unfreundlich aufgefordert das Restaurant zu verlassen, dass ich entgegnete: \"Nein, ich habe hierf√ºr bezahlt und ich gehe erst, wenn ich mit dem Essen fertig bin.\" Jedenfalls hat sie solange weiter pampig geschimpft, dass ich ihren Chef sprechen wollte. \nDas geht √ºberhaupt nicht, man ist doch zahlender Kunde. Sie hatte aber noch Gl√ºck, denn bei dem bl√∂den Kommentar, dass sie doch putzen m√ºsse h√§tte ich ihr am liebsten den schei√ü Burger auf den Boden geschmissen.. dann h√§tte sie wenigstens was zu tun gehabt.\nUnversch√§mtheit"}
{"text":"Atmosph√§re? Gibt's hier nicht. Gut, ist ein McDonalds, da sollte man auch nichts erwarten, allerdings gibt es auch wesentlich besser eingerichtete L√§den dieser Kette. Nun ist man hier im Hauptbahnhof, da ist der McDonalds wohl noch mehr Durchgangsstation als ohnehin schon. Es hat alles so was schmuddeliges. Aber man kann sein Essen ja mitnehmen. Das ist immerhin von der √ºblichen Standardqualit√§t. Nur der Orangensaft  SOLL der so schmecken? Gebe zu, ich habe den noch nie zuvor probiert. Und wenn das immer so schmeckt, kann dieser spezielle Laden auch nichts daf√ºr. Aber: B√§h. Nun ja."}
{"text":"Ich war schon in vielen McDonald's hier in der Umgebung, aber der am HBF sticht besonders negativ heraus.\n\n\n Musste mit dem Fahrzeug aus der Innenstadt Richtung Autobahn. Dachte mir, ich hole noch schnell ein paar Burger, gesagt - getan. Aber nicht doch.\n\n\n Obwohl ich sehr schnell vorne an der Reihe war, wurde ich erst einmal ignoriert, aus welchen Gr√ºnden auch immer, jedenfalls war die Dame anderweitig besch√§ftigt. \nNach 3min. vergebenem Wartens, sprach ich sie an, ich w√ºrde gerne bestellen wollen. Als Antwort bekam ich nur \"warten! warten!\" ...\nDas tat ich dann, wenngleich es mir schwer fiel, bei diesem rotzigen Ton. Nachdem ich dann kurze Zeit sp√§ter bestellen konnte (4 Cheeseburger), dauerte es erst einmal eine Weile, bis die Burger fertig waren. Wundert mich schon ein wenig, der Andrang am HBF wird sicher etwas h√∂her sein, das setzt eine gewissen Kalkulation voraus!\n\n\n Schlie√ülich packte sie mir alle drei Burger in die T√ºte, der vierte fiel auf den Boden. Nat√ºrlich, der Burger ist von einer T√ºte umwickelt, mir ist das egal, ich will keinen Burger, der auf dem Boden lag. Das wollte die Dame nicht akzeptieren, schlie√ülich ist er ja gesch√ºtzt...\nNach einer weiteren Diskussion platze mir nun endg√ºltig der Kragen, auch ich wurde jetzt zunehmend unfreundlich (nicht zuletzt, weil es nicht sein kann, dass ich f√ºr die Bestellung von 4 Cheeseburger einen Zeitaufwand von √º. 20min. einplanen muss) und verlangte den Chef. \nDieser kam dann auch gleich, ich schilderte ihm das Problem, bekam dann meinen \"neuen\" Burger. Unverst√§ndlich, wieso das nicht sofort ging.\n\n\n Im Allgemeinen kann ich sagen, dass dieser McDonald's neben dem unqualifizierten Personal auch sehr dreckig ist, was den Essbereich in der Filiale selbst angeht. Tische werden kaum bis gar nicht geputzt und auch die Tablettwagen werden sehr selten geleert. Das f√ºhrt dann dazu, dass jeder Gast sein Tablett einfach auf dem Tisch stehen l√§sst - verst√§ndlicher Weise.\n\n\n Vielleicht erwarte ich einfach zu viel, aber ich weiss eben auch, dass es besser geht, zum Beispiel am McDonald's Flughafen, welcher vorbildlich ist, in jeder Hinsicht."}

I was there for a second time in two weeks and the same result both times - it took over 15 minutes to get coffee and two breakfast sandwiches during the traditional breakfast menu hours.  There are crew members just standing around with no sense of direction and the manager is mean, crabby, an quite frankly overwhelmed as she is trying to run register and take care of all of the customers both dining in and in the drive-thru.  You would think in an area like Wexford, you would have the opposite service and experience.  I thought maybe my first visit with the same result was an anomaly and I would give them another chance, but that is clearly not the case.  Additional feedback was sent to your corporate office as the survey on my receipt reflected both of these awful experiences."}

After a long day, and after making a decision to actually go to McDonald's, the least they could do is provide some kind of positive experience.  The latest time I visited, there was a simple order of two extra value meals, and two sundaes.  It seems to be impossible for this location to keep their ice cream/ shake machine in repair, as it is broken, or \"being cleaned\" just about every time we go through the drive thru.  So, no ice cream.  As we pulled up to the window, (to pay, mind you), there was NO ONE there. I mean, we waited a full five minutes, and heard voices in the building, so it's not like they all vanished.  Apparently, whoever was working the window just decided to go on a break.  We drove off, and found food, else where.  This location has a reputation for getting orders wrong, having a non-functioning/out of service/\"being cleaned\" ice cream/shake maker, and the drive-thru window being abandoned for periods of time.  Clearly, the management of this location is not doing their job, and the reason for the high turnover in the fast food industry can be illustrated by the failure of this location."}

I odered a cheeseburger and a Big Mac.  Both were dry. The mouth feel of these sandwiches was horrible! The meat was more like tofu than beef. The fries served mostly as a delivery for salt. Bad food. And though the place was not busy, the wait was too long. Never again."}
{"text":"McDs is a classic and with an extensive menu that includes a healthier fare, it makes it easier to go back time and time again.\nA huge plus that McDonald's offers is free WiFi. One doesn't even have to be a customer to pop in an use it and this feature makes for good public relations.\nThanks McDs.\nHOWEVER, with all that's good, there is the down side and that's the kids' area. Filled with video games and interactive movies, kids are running and screaming through this area, still indoors, and dragging chairs everywhere they go. Oh if only the chairs had plastic feet, but they are gone, so one has to endure the metal against tile time and time again.\nSo if you are serious about getting anything done on your laptop, go right next door to Chick-fil-A, where things are a little quieter."}

{"text":"This newer McDonald's floor plan is well laid out and gets a lot of natural light. The child's play area is wonderful and is much nicer than the McDonald's at Power & McKellips. \n\nMy son loves being able to play basketball and bowling on the 3 video touch screens. The only thing keeping this McDonald's from getting a 5-star rating is the lack of a Koala Changing Station in the men's room (and women's I would assume) and the lack of adult table-seating in the play area. \n\nAccording to Google, the Koala Changing Stations are only $185; it seems to me to be a major oversight at a location that has such a nice child play area. \n\nOtherwise, the staff was nice and the restaurant itself was clean."}
{"text":"This McDonalds location should be shut down.  While the Drive-Thru was quick, the food was terrible.  I wanted to try the new Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich and someone from work wanted a Double Cheeseburger so I grabbed those and was on my way.  The Double Cheeseburger was ice cold (after a 2 minute drive) and the chicken sandwich was fried for too long and extremely dry.  Fries were also cold.\n\nQuality management seems to be very poor at this location as that food should never have been allowed to go out.  \n\nI would advise strongly against this location."}
{"text":"After a bad experience at the nearby KFC, I decided to go to McDonald's. The drive-through line was pretty short, and I had wasted a lot of time at KFC. I was in a hurry. The lady who took my order was very pleasant, she even handed me my coins before the bills, when she gave me accurate change. I like this because that means the coins did not spill all over the ground, like they do at many other places. The gentleman who handed me my order was very friendly, such a gentleman. He handed me my food and wished me a wonderful day. Eye contact and everything.  I felt pretty satisfied with my customer service experience. The fries were fresh, and my only complaint is that the cheeseburger did not have enough catsup. McDonald's is not bore me eating by any means, but it was quick and efficient. And those are pretty important when you have only so much time for lunch. Thank you McDonald's!"}
{"text":"Buyer beware! The young people on the register will Scam you if you aren't paying attention.\n\n I went thru the drive up window yesterday. when I pulled up to the intercom. I ordered 2 Big breakfast platters with hotcakes.  The gentleman charged for 2 big breakfast on the screen without hotcakes. When I read the screen. I asked the employee \" that's with hotcakes right?\" Answer was yes. I pull around & pay slightly over $10. He asked if I wanted a receipt. Which I unfortunately turned down.\n\nNow I pull up to the window & receive 2 big breakfasts No hotcakes. When I asked the girl if syrup was in the bag before I looked. She appeared bewildered & replied \" you didn't order hot cakes\" \nI replied that actually I did & the order was messed up. I gave her a $10 & asked her to make it right. I received $3 change back.  \nSo now I'm up to $16 for 2 big breakfasts with hotcakes. Honestly didn't care at all, until I got home & there wasn't any hash browns.  Come on McDonalds keep your employee's from SCAMMING the customer."}
{"text":"WOW, what a dirty McDonalds.  Gum, fries and trash all over the floors.  Bathrooms are worse, stuff smeared on walls, tons of buildup in corners and urinals/toilets stained with stuff.  One of the worst I have ever seen, Micky D's are usually clean.  \n\nOther than that, nice layout and playplace for kids.  There is also a huge open space opposite the play place that could fit a lot more tables.  I guess they don't get that many people being so dirty."}
{"text":"Filthy! The whole restaurant needs a deep\nCleaning. The drink/ketchup station is disgusting! Invest in some toothbrushes and clean the cracks!! The play area is gross too, my kids came\nOut black!! And they jipped\nMe on my smoothies!"}
{"text":"FAIL ....ok it's macks  lots happening  today so I dart over for a quick breakfast for the wife and I egcmuffin meal and sausage and egg mc muffin meal get home hash brown both hard as rock must have got cooked way to long sausage and egg muffin ......NO egg called location left message for the manager to call me so I could at least get what I paid for  no return call ........FAIL"}
{"text":"If you come here after midnight be prepared to wait an hour or more. I think they cook it all to order after processing the meat first.or something. No reason for such a long wait. I've been in the drive thru for 15 minutes and still haven't even got to the window to pay for my order yet."}
{"text":"McDonald's is what it is, all their products are standard. What sets a McDonald's apart are the staff. Most of the staff here show customers how much they hate their jobs. Go and quit so another person who actually want a job can have one! \n\nI swear 2 years ago an idiot thought I was someone she knew and when I told her that I wasn't who she thought I was she told me that \"we\" all look the same anyway! WTF and what's worst is how casually she said it!  I couldn't believe it!"}
{"text":"This is STILL one of the better McDonald's locations in an urban location. They get your orders right most of them & prepare them well. This time, a little goof, one extra small Earl Grey Tea, Hot we didn't order. How terrible! We got something extra, free! I typically order Earl Grey, Hot with a LOT of milks, 3 or 4, when I'm not at my best in the morning, a little shaky. It fixes me up! But I digress. This is the typical mistake they *might* make--too much stuff, not too little. And they never ignore you or consistently get orders wrong (that's the specialty of the Weston-401 Crossroads McDonald's location :P) But I digress again.\n\nWanted to tell you about the new Zesty BLT wrap, a promotional item. Toronto virtually invented the BLT sandwich along with the Banquet Burger & we know how to do it best. Good green crisp lettuce. McD? Check! The lettuce was the best part of it, totally! My teeth sank into it, just the right texture. Al dente. VERY fresh. VERY dark green. VERY nutritious/healthy, everything a good lettuce should be. ;-) Full marks, McD. Bacon, the candy of meats? Crispy, but not TOO crispy. But not full flavoured, so not full marks. Maybe 8 out of 10. What about the T part? Good Grief, Charlie Brown! McD Ingram forgot to add any tomatoes!!  Well, I don't want 'em anyway if they are hothouse grown tasteless pink bicycle tires (TY George Carlin, for that image!). I prefer heirloom, field grown tomatoes. Yellow ones, grape tomatoes, and the ultimate tomato taste: kumato! (If you see brownish olive tomatoes at the supermarket and labelled kumato, grab 'em fast & try 'em--sweet nirvana in your sandwich! You'll never touch a pink bicycle tire again!) I digress yet again. So yeah, McD Ingram, the wrap would have been better with the T in it. But it was still very very good on this big dumping of snow overnight morning. The Zesty part? It was supposed to have jalape√±o mayo sauce. There was none. I LOATHE mayonnaise. Yucky calorie laden stuff with an aftertaste! Give my ranch dressing anyday! Flavour without aftertaste. On the other hand, I  jalape√±os or anything spicy, HELLO Sriracha! So yeah, it would have been nice to experience the Zesty part. But you know what? I didn't miss it! Cause the wrap tasted great. Moist enough to carry the scrambled eggs (which were done to moistness but the blob of egg was falling out of the wrap) but maybe that was the complicated not well designed cardboard packaging for the McD wraps' fault. The fact that I liked this new featured item on the McDonald's breakfast menu this much despite it being missing the tomatoes and the jalape√±o mayo sauce tells me that Zesty BLT Wrap should be a keeper!"}
{"text":"I gotta say one of the worse McDonald I ever been to. Not only my food and fries are always cold, I waited over 10 mins each time in drive thru. \nThe staff aren't friendly at all. Maybe the team here should go visit the St.Clair location McDonald. Always fast fresh and friendly.... \n\nNot good. Sorry !"}
{"text":"Okay okay I get it.... 5 stars for McDonalds but here's why.  I spent two mornings in a row at this McDonald's waiting for my car to be fixed.  The first day I came in after the morning rush around 10:15 or so.  A woman behind the counter with a bright yellow flowers tucked into her hair was smiling and asking to take my order.  Smiling after the morning rush?  I was impressed.  Ordered my coffee and settled in to use the free wifi and relax for a few hours.  While sitting there and watching I realized that this McDonald's is kept very clean.  The tables were regularly wiped down, so was the garbage bins.  The garbage was checked on and taken out when full.  Everything worked like clock work. The staff were very friendly with customers which makes me believe they are treated well and genuinely happy to be there.  The 2nd day I had the same experience.  Same lady with the flower except it was orange and a lot of the same customers.  It might be McDonald's but it clearly has a neighbourhood kinda feel to it.  While I was there police pulled over a car into the McDonald's parking lot.  While they were busy writing a ticket for the driver the police were joking around.  Even allowed the driver to get out and go into McDonald's and get some food while they continued to write the ticket.... Maybe the good moods are infectious?"}
{"text":"24 hours my butt. Now this is the third time I've gone and have been told it's closed. Everyday between 3am and 4am it's closed. Seriously if you're not going to serve people for 24 hours out of the day, don't advertise being open for them."}
{"text":"McDonald's generally sucks anyway, but the service here is especially incompetent. I'm always astounded by the line of cars at the drive thru who seem perfectly content to sit and wait for some garbage to stuff down their gullets when it would take less time to cook something good at home."}
{"text":"Slowest moving workers at McDonald's everrrrrrr. Even at 10 at night or 2 in the morning it takes 15 minutes to make a regular ass burger.. -.-"}
{"text":"Came in at this location for a quick breakfast bite before going to Lake Mead Recreational Park. I honestly couldn't believe their service here. I lost count on how many orders they had messed up in the 8 minutes I was standing at the counter to receive my order. I was surprised they didn't messed up my order, but the wait time for two sausage mcmuffins was unbelievable.\nWould not recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"First time at this location and although it was crowded service was great. My order was actually correct which is a surprise since I had more than 1 order."}
{"text":"Haven't Eaten McDonald's in Forever Because Of This Location !! Worst Customer Services Ever !!"}
{"text":"A month ago I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich from this restaurant and it had dirt wrapped in with it. I haven't been back since. The sandwich smelled just like fish. How is it possible that a chicken sandwich could end up smelling like fish? I complained to the manager and she didn't show any sympathy whatsoever.  She made no apologies at all.  I was deeply disturbed and highly offended by her lack of customer service skills.  They then took another half hour to make a new sandwich. It was the worst experience at McDonald's in my life."}
{"text":"This place is lousy! The staff are not clean. This young white guy had something yucky on his finger and I wanted to puke! They cannot make the Frappe well; too thick and too icy! The food is never hot! The clerks at the drive thru act like they are not concerned. I love the McD's on the corner of Nellis and Las Vegas Blvd!"}
{"text":"I have to say this place is very busy in the mornings and the drive thru is packed. Normally 8 plus cars so i simply walk inside. The staff and service is EXCELLENT, They are clearly busy but they don't let the customer see the stress. From the time I order my food to the time I get it is usually less then 2 minuets.\nAgain the staff is great and very polite. Smiles on everyone's faces!\nThanks to all the Staff."}
{"text":"The service here depends greatly on the time and day. On slow days service is pretty fast vice versa on busy ones. The employees are great people. They maintain a decent attitude and provide good service. The dining room is usually well kept though not as much when it's busy."}
{"text":"Like the fact there's a play place at this location for my kids... However- the service was slow. I mean, a 10 minute wait between ordering and receiving food slow. The manager mentioned a couple times that I was waiting and my order needed to be up, but still, I waited... No compensation (usually for less than average service McDonald's gives you an apple pie or some treat to help apologize) but nope. Nothing. Not so much as a sorry for the wait. I can't dig poor customer service from such a big name as McDonald's not to mention how pricey their food has gotten... Probably won't be back. Oh, at least the food was good otherwise I would've done more complaining!"}
{"text":"I am So Sorry for doing this...but Yep, I have Experienced Better Service at other Locations. \n\nThe numerous time I have been here wanting Ice Cream, they have mentioned that their Ice Cream Machine was Not Working, The Customer Service could be Alot Better! And, this place could use a good scrubbing! \n\nI hate t give these kinds of Reviews, but when I don't get a Good vibe about a Place, I tend Not to Frequent it any longer!"}
{"text":"4:30 am and a long drive home only means, McDonalds Hashbrowns.  Then maybe a Sausage Mcmuffin with Cheese.\n\nSo it was me, my son, my uncle and my mom.  This was to start I day.  I hate to say it but breakfast on the go has to be McDonalds.\n\nWe all got our respective breakfast sandwiches and drinks.  But the thing of note for me was the fact that we ordered 7 Hashbrowns.  The drive thru lady kept repeating \"7\"?  \n\nYes, 7 Hashbrowns.  We're a Hashbrown loving family."}
{"text":"Wanted to get a quick something to eat, went thru the drive thru and was pretty fast.\nwhen I picked up my food and got home to eat..it was not what I ordered.\nGet a clue???"}
{"text":"The service was pretty fast but the food was awful. The bun was stale and have the impression that the burger was made yesterday and reheated. Yuck!"}
{"text":"A horrid first time. You get judged the moment you walk through. I ordered a number 8 which was a crispy but I was given a 7 which was a grilled. I had them fix it and they apologized with an apple pie. Then I heard someone say to not give it away. So that's cool."}
{"text":"This drive-thru is so slow! I sat in line 15 minutes for a hot coffee. Needless to say it was cold when I received it because it had been sitting on the counter waiting for my turn at the window. The managers should be asking themselves where the breakdown is."}
{"text":"Pretty good...for mc donald's."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend the strawberry lemonade ! The lobby is clean and when another customer spilled their drink, the staff cleaned it up right away!"}
{"text":"Too many homeless/druggies hanging around this location makes it uncomfortable for the patrons of this establishment. Every time I frequent this place I am greeted by \"do you have some spare change for the bus\" routine or \"do you think I can get a ride from you up the street? I would use the drive thru, but McDonald's employees aren't always on point with getting the order correct and there have been many times where I've had to go back in and tell them."}
{"text":"Most every morning they mess up my coffee! I don't understand, the order board reads 8 sugars and my receipt  reads 8 sugars and then my coffee comes out with all cream and no sugar. I just don't understand."}
{"text":"Excellent drive thru dude! I would have given them a perfect score, but the chick he was working with wanted charge extra sauce, when he was just trying to hook it up! Thanks for trying man:)"}
{"text":"Clean, but super slow. \n\nSo here's the deal, after setting up my car with new speakers and a stereo at the Best Buy across the street, I had to wait for a couple of hours while they installed everything. I had two separate installs and ended up hanging out at this McDonald's on both occasions. Here are my two observations: \n\n1. The cashiers are super slow at taking orders and getting food orders out. It was unreal how long I had to wait both times for the gal to get my order ready after I placed it. She walked around unhappily with a frown the whole time, then just stood there as my food was made and was ready to be served up. This occurred at slow times in the day as well, not busy times.\n\n2. This place is actually one of the cleaner McDonald's that I've been to. There is ample seating inside and the place offers free wifi as well. Of course, they also have a sign that tells customers they have to leave after 30 minutes (must be a problem they have), so that's a bit of a put-off as a legitimate customer. Not sure if they enforce that though, they didn't with me. \n\nSo in the end, this McDonald's SHOULD be better than 2-stars. It's in a good location, it is cleaner than most locations, and the food is fresh. However, the crappy attitude and painfully slow service kills it for me at this location. I would only come back if I was waiting on Best Buy again for service to my car."}
{"text":"Transient and druggies hangout. Pan handling patrons as they walk in and out while at the same time the same bums are charging their cell phones inside the dining room.  They allow these filthy beggers to gather as a meeting place and park their cars in the parking lot while they walk over to the freeway with their pathetic signs and beg working people for their money.  Mcdonalds needs to put a stop to allowing these low life's to use their establishment for this purpose. Until they clean it up I won't be back and from the looks of the other reviews neither will others."}
{"text":"The dude at the drive-thru never fails to mess up my order...granted it's a coffee drink which can be complicated. However, it's the only thing I ever purchase and I'm saddened each and every time I opt to go there out of convenience. Can't beat the price though."}
{"text":"Ordered a sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle, got mcgriddle bread. No sausage. No egg. No cheese. Are you freaking kidding me? I've had some bad experiences with McDonald's, but this is definitely a first."}
{"text":"Fucking slow, 2 cars in the drive through and been here 20 minutes. The bitch looks like she should be working at a truck stop in the middle of Kentucky with her hill hilly ass. Fucking stupid. Avoid this place"}
{"text":"Fast service. Friendly employees. Pumpkin spice was horrible tastes like extra dark coffee I couldn't even drink it. I threw it away and went to Starbucks they cost the same but at Starbucks actually taste like pumpkin spice. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Average location in every way. Food order was correct and hot. Employees were average, but nothing to brag about. Restaurant was clean and well stocked. Getting in and out of this location is not easy since you have to go into the shopping area off of Thunderbird, turn into the Lowes parking lot and then turn into McDonalds parking lot; no direct access from Thunderbird."}
{"text":"Very slow service been waiting for a salad for 20 minutes.  It's worth the drive to go somewhere else.  Avoid this McDonalds!"}
{"text":"It's alright but it gets way too busy here. You could drive down to the Thunderbird/43rd Ave McDonald's and be back on the I-17 in the time it takes to get in and out of this drive-thru."}
{"text":"Well, this time they forgot a couple burgers, but this is a first at this McDonalds.  At leadt they were friendly and even reognized me 15 minutes later.  Issue quickly corrected witg a smile."}
{"text":"Great service!! The folks at counter were really friendly and the layout at this location was really nice (comfortable chairs with and decent LCD)."}
{"text":"I went through drive through and ordered a chicken sandwich. After driving down the road, I realized they gave me a quarter pounder. I returned to the  store and went inside, they took my QP and put it BACK IN THE HEATING BIN!!! I was shocked! I called the health department to report it. Also, it took them three times to remake my food and still got it wrong. Cheese and may only is that hard to understand??"}
{"text":"Worst service I have received.   When I got here around 545am there were 3 waiting and nobody up front.  There was 1 lady wearing a blue shirt who seemed to be doing EVERYTHING even though there were other employees working, she was the ONLY one with a sense of urgency to help guests!   English in here is a foreign language even in front of guests, they don't care.  The only bright spot to this place in the morning is the lady wearing blue and other times a very nice black man who came in at 6am, he is always pleasant and courteous.   NOBODY ELSE SEEMS TO GIVE A DAMN!!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Quality of service is so mundane and unprofessional. I always come in to study since this McDonald's  seems like a nice and quiet place to study after-hours, but the associates here are loud, and sometimes get out of hand. You tend to overhear all the at-work drama and complaints of the workers. \n\nIt's barely midnight and they apparently shut off their ice cream machine and don't tell you until you're ready to pay. Seriously, what McDonald's has their ice cream machine shut off? Oh and my apple pie was cold AF from sitting too long and previously over-browned from baking too long. How do they manage to do that?!\n\nTwo stars for having guests feel awkward during their dine-in and two stars for their inadequate system of delivering less than ok food."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is super clean and cozy since they did a complete renovation inside and out. Normally I would not take the time out to complete a Yelp review for this establishment however this location is really nice! It has that College lounge relaxing atmosphere that is welcoming for students and all who want some chill time. Nice comfy cushy black pleather chairs and small intimate tables, colorful art on the walls, easy to relax, eat, study, or use their wi-fi for Internet access.\n\nAll you can drink serve yourself fountain drinks are always a plus at McDonald's! The only thing is they do not keep the fresh brewed iced tea or sweet tea out like other locations do so you will have to ask for refills on that. \n\nThe food is good and the staff is fast and ready to go with your order!"}
{"text":"Wow never in a million years o would think I'll review a McDonald's BUT I had such a horrible experience at this very particular location literally few hours ago (07/28 12:10am-12:50am) when trying to order through the drive-thru, it fckn took them almost a fckn hour! I left before I even had a chance to order, I got so fed up and even 2 cars behind us left as well. What's even more frustrating is the idiot at the very last window (where u were supposed to make an order) was just casually talking to the first car in front of us for nearly 45 min, NOT even bothering to tell us whether there was something wrong because the wait was just too fckn long! Fck ur terrible service!!!"}
{"text":"Not much of a McDonald's fan but whenever I want to get a quick and easy morning breakfast i like to come to this location it's close to my house it's a little laid back and relaxing outside of the panhandlers and a few of the homeless and shady people that frequent this location this is one of the few McDonald's location i like to visit the customer service is okay at best and the service is good not great overall I like this McDonald's location."}
{"text":"I just been called CRAZY!! By one of the menbers  at this mc donals in decatur and flamingo!! I order a queter pounder de luxe , and the cashier lady ask me medium or large , i was thinking a large burger , so i order a large one!!! Big mistake!! It was a big frys!! No no no no!!!! Dont take your custumers as a fools!!! Anyways i ask to speak to the manager and this girl comes out , make in fun of me!! Cause everybody hear she call me CRAZY!!!! I never never coming back at this place!!! RUDE!!!"}
{"text":"What no Sweet Tea!  This is the only McDonald's I know that does not serve Sweet Tea!!!"}
{"text":"Worst McDonalds I've ever been to. The bathrooms we always locked so you have to ask a worker to press a button so it could open and the cashier would get an attitude when the doors wouldn't work. When we placed our order, the cashier was monotone and annoyed. The woman preparing the food orders was hard-working, fast, and friendly. As for the food, it's the same as any other McDonald's . And to make things worse, the cashier handed my dad a wet rag when he said that the table he wanted was dirty. She didn't even offer to clean it or anything. That's the epitome of laziness. Dont come here!!"}
{"text":"If I could punch the lady, I would. I am very sure the girl who helped me was the manager and she threw me a bunch of attitude. I only asked \"Large Iced Mocha\", how hard can it be???? And guess what I got? Large Caramel Mocha and I asked her politely if I could get my order right because I really don't like caramel. She gave me the dirtiest look ever and walked away from the drive-thru. I head her saying \"I am not making the drink again for her.\" I was like\" what the heck?\" I was this close to go down to the store and start yelling at that stupid lady but good thing my boyfriend was next to me so I just stayed quit. 10 seconds later, the other manager (a guy) came and helped me out. I told him whoever just helped me had a problem! He was nice though and he also apologized to me. That lady needs to be fired soon."}
{"text":"They recently remodeled this place and it looks awesome! The only concern I have is, the seating area. I came here for breakfast a few times and stand around for somewhere to sit down....."}
{"text":"The renovation is good but the best part is the change of management. It has made all the difference in the world. The orders are now coming out correct. Thanks for the changes"}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite before a football camp. The food was typical McDonald's processed junk ( ummmm delicious). The attitude however, was not ok. The lady at the drive through had a really bad attitude and acted as if she were upset that I came to her window. I'm sorry I didn't mean to bother you with my annoying ordering of food. Nonetheless, you get what you pay for.\n\nThis entire area can be hit and miss. At times it appears to be overrun with transient folks (homeless), and other times its free and clear. My largest complaint though is the employees poor attitude. Why have her working the drive thru? Ill be honest if I'm in a pinch and absolutely have to grab a bite ill return. But i will not be making any special trips to come back to this Mc D's."}
{"text":"Gross !! Ordered a sausage mcmuffin. Got home to enjoy it, opened the wrapper. The muffin was burnt!! Also drive thru took forever"}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE LEAVING!!! I'm not one to complain or even care much when my order is messed up; as I work in the food industry, and understand that shot happens.. But it's happened more than 3 times now, at around 12 am- (not a busy time) \nJust make sure you get what your paying for, it's not fun to get home and not have someone's meal."}
{"text":"The manager here WISHES I'd call her a C-U-Next-Tuesday! But with the nightmare \"service\" she provided, there is no way I'd EVER go back next Tuesday or any other day for that matter. Bye Felicia!\n\nThe miserable experience began with us placing our breakfast orders.  The cashier must've gone hard on the Vegas paint the night before because he could NOT get our order right if his job and life depended on it.  Normally, this would be quite frustrating but I get it...it's New Years weekend and you're stuck behind a McD's cash register at the crack of dawn #thestruggleisreal.\n\nHowever, the empathy felt for the cashier quickly wore off as informs us that they are all out of orange juice. Say what? We proceed to ask if we can wait until they make more only to have him repeat that they are completely out of OJ.  Dafuq? Can someone tell me how this is possible? I stood there wondering if he was going to tell me they were all out of egg mcmuffins and hasbrowns next. In the interest of not exhausting our hangover any further, we opt for apple juice instead.\n\nJust when we thought we avoided a headache, we find out a bigger migraine was around the corner. The most unprofessional, rude, and disrespectful witch, wearing a manager's outfit, started bagging up our order.  She shouts our number and tosses us the bags and walks away. Zero condiments in the bags and ZERO customer service...I'm not sure why I am surprised because who has ever been to a McDonalds that actually offered customers any condiments? -_-\n\nSince our order was a bit larger than the average order, we do a quick check to see if we have everything. Naturally, the order was incorrect.  Not only were we missing parts of our order but we got items we didn't even order and in the wrong quantities, no less.\n\nWhen we try to point the errors out to her, she gives us a look that should be reserved for someone who runs over your dog and laughs about it.  Her devil horns begin to show and it felt like her devil tail slapped me in the face as she rips the receipt out of my hand to inspect our claims of her incompetency.\n\nAs she goes thru the receipt line by line, she still had the nerve to continue insisting the order was correct. Excuse me, lady, but you are talking to a veteran McFatty with many years of McD's visits under her belt, so there is no way I am going to mistake a plain Egg Mcmuffin for a Sausage Egg McGriddle...\n\nEventually, she caves and starts correcting our order, while she yammers on about how she does not know why the order was wrong. Not a single apology was uttered. We bite our tongues and spare her the \"I told you so\" attitude because we were now battling the onset of the migraine she was inflicting on us. \n\nWhile we waited for her to figure out our sandwich orders, I reminded her that I still did not get the cups for the drinks we ordered.  She flies back to the counter on her witch's broom to INSIST that she gave us the cups already. She must've had a sudden bout of amnesia bcs. didn't we just review the receipt and determine that certain things were missing i.e. our drinks????\n\nAfter waiting for what felt like eons, our order was finally corrected...minus the lack of condiments, cream, and sugar, etc.  At this point, none of had the willpower to battle McSatan for some ketchup, so we just grabbed our items and hightailed it to the car.  Needless to say, our breakfast home from Vegas was filled with very black, bitter coffee and very cold sandwiches...much like that manager's very black, bitter and very cold heart. \n\nI don't care how hungover or high you are or how convenient this McD's is to wherever you are...DO NOT COME HERE!!! if you're in Vegas and the only options were to go here or Timbuktu for a quick bite to eat, I'd have my credit card, passport, and my neck pillow set for the McFlight to Africa."}
{"text":"I usually wouldn't write a review for McDonald's but this particular location deserves a positive review. \n\nI've went there twice this week. Once for breakfast and the other time for a quick dinner. The workers at this location are unbelievably nice. \n\nThey have the best customer service I've received from any McDonald's or any other food establishment, honestly. From the person taking your money at the first window to the person handing you your order at the second, this location has the nicest workers ever. They always treat me like they know me well! \n\nDefinitely received very positive vibes and speedy service from this location. McDonald's should use their customer service as a blue print for all locations."}
{"text":"What's to review about this fast-food chain that no one doesn't know about already. As some of you may have noticed, I frequently check in to McDonalds every morning mon-friday before work for my QUICK FIX of Premium Roast Coffee. It's THAT good to me to where I have become an addict. I love when its freshly made and hot...makes my tummy and whole body warm during the winter of Vegas. And obviously, I would not just NOT order breakfast items on the $1 menu -- hashbrowns and sausage egg mcmuffin to compliment my wonderful coffee.  ^_^\n\nThis particular McDonalds is like any other establishments. Nothing to really brag about except the fact that its conveniently located to my home and they get you in and out as quickly as possible in the drive-thru. Just make sure you double check your orders, might be missing something."}
{"text":"it's a toss up for this location and the one on the strip across from four seasons for worst McDonald's. every time I come to this location no matter what I order a large order for three or just a ice cream cone the wait time is horrible. sometimes you'll pull up to the speaker and it takes forever for someone to say anything and start taking your order. there's prob one or two workers in drive thru that do a ok job. I've had my order messed up here multiple times also"}
{"text":"As McDonalds goes this one gets my higher rating (for the brand) of 3 stars.\n1. They have a $1 menu unlike many others in Vegas.\n2. They give the drink cup when you order vs making people wait is great! (It's 'policy' at most McD's to make us wait to get our drink)\n3. Friendly staff, it's my 4th visit and I've seen smiles each time."}
{"text":"Why does this location allow people to stand outside by the entrance asking customers for money?"}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's I have ever been to in my life. So many issues  that I don't know where to start:\n- Bathrooms were disgusting \n- Menu TVs were broken so you couldn't even see the menu\n- Cashier couldn't tell you anything about food\n- No ranch for kids' nuggets\n- Fries were cold\n\nJust to name a few..."}

W√§hrend mein Mann anstand, wollte ich auf die Toilette. Tja, die (ohnehin seit l√§ngerer Zeit reparaturbed√ºrftig) waren ebenso wenig gereinigt wie der Rest  es ist schon aussagekr√§ftig, wenn man von mehreren M√ºttern unabh√§ngig begr√º√üt wird, die mit der Flasche Desinfektionsmittel in der Hand ihren Kindern gerade zurufen:Fass hier blo√ü nix an! Die Warteschlangen waren lang  wir sind ohne etwas zu Essen wieder raus."}
{"text":"gut gelegen, sonst typisch mcd"}
{"text":"Moderner, gro√üer und saubere Mc Donald's in Feuerbach.\nIn der Mittagszeit ist hier richtig was los und die Wartezeiten sind trotz 5 Kassen relativ lange.\n\n\n Aus Fahrtrichtung Stuttgart muss man erst an dem Mc Donald's vorbeifahren um dann einen U-Turn zumachen. Es gibt keine direkte M√∂glichkeit abzubiegen."}
{"text":"Sehr sauber und gepflegt... \nUngew√∂hnlich f√ºr diese fast food kette und auch das essen war schnell und frisch zubereitet... das jedoch lag wohl an der sp√§ten  uhrzeit... Toiletten waren ebenfalls sauber und ein airblade f√ºr die trocknung!\n\nDie atmosph√§re dank des rundbaus und der aussicht mal ganz was anders."}
{"text":"Seit dem Umbau ist alles besser. Getr√§nke zum selber nachschenken. Sauberkeit geht in Ordnung. Mit Cafe und mit WLAN."}
{"text":"Ich hab leider auf der McDonalds Homepage keine √ñffnungszeiten gefunden. Allerdings scheint diese Filliale immer aufzuhaben. Vor allem am Wochenende ist bis sp√§t in die Nacht Hochbetrieb. Entsprechend schwer ist es, einen Sitzplatz zu kriegen. Etwas schwer zu erreichen. Am besten entweder einen U-Turn machen (dauert allerdings etwas, weil die n√§chste M√∂glichkeit einige Hundert Meter weiter ist) oder beim Selgros durchfahren und vom Mediamarkt aus kommen."}
{"text":"In duieser Filiale wird man nett bedient, ich kann es nicht anders sagen. Die Sauberkeit ist auch in Ordnung. Die Burger waren warm, recht lauwarm, aber das scheint hier normal zu sein."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this McDonalds. They can't stick with one structure. It's either two lines or one line. Then there's another line for order pick up which people waiting in line get mixed up in. Part of it is once you walk in it is one aisle the merges directly to the cashier. Messes things up.\n\nThey have recently upgraded their screens so now it's super high tech and very appealing. Only problem with this is now they are showing McDonald's ads which takes the customer away from the actual menu for about 20 seconds. So imagine you get to the cashier and you need to make a decision on your order but have to wait for the ad to go by before you see the menu and then you are limited in time before the ad pops up again. Just not efficient at all.\n\nThey have a separate kids zone which I take advantage of if you want peace and want to avoid the crowd. Yes it's or kids but when kids are in school and you're there during lunch then i'll endure Caillou for 20 mins and eat at peace.\n\nRestaurant is clean and drinks are self serve, which is awesome for refills. Not all locations have implemented this yet.\n\nI would say this place is neutral.. nothing special about it."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh. I'm so ashamed of myself. I love being healthy but once in a while a man has to treat himself to a McFlurry and some nuggets! And a fishwich... Some some friends.. A fountain drink... Pie. \n\nAnyways, this mcdonalds is okay. The workers in the back seem to have fun and the cashiers are always nice. One of them is this super cute girl with too much makeup on. I totally had a James Blunt \"You're beautiful\" moment.... Until my food arrived. Then I had a om nom nom moment. Then... Food coma and regret. \n\nAnyways anyways, decent mcdonalds. No drive through. Some sketchy characters. Give the coffee a chance. \n\nIf you can walk past the curtain of shame and regret, you can have a great cheat meal here."}
{"text":"This branch is a bit substandard compared to other McDonald I have been to. \n\nMy colleague ordered the salad and from where I was sitting the lettuce looked piss poor I'm quality. At least the salad dressing was pretty. Ice. \n\nAs for our burgers it seemed to be assembled haphazardly and was falling apart."}
{"text":"This location, just like any other, have renovate into new design, good location, service is good during rush hours, see a employee walk around the lobby to make sure the cleanliness of the restaurant.  Food is not bad, like their Big Breakfast"}
{"text":"Not here to complain about the Food at McDonald because they are great. However... I went to McDonalds, yesterday and u know the coupons u get from mcdonald. Well, one of them said buy one and get the next one for free. Btw this happened many times to me. I got my self 6 piece mc nuggets for both the free and the one i want to buy and fries, additionally i bought my self a mc double. Stupid me didn't look inside the bag, till i got home. Inside the bag there was one box of mc nuggets with a mc double double. i didn't not get the other box. U might think why cry over not having a box of chicken nuggets that were meant to be free. Well sir or mam, one box feeds a person in the family and since there wasn't another one, another had to stay empty stomach, knowing we aren't rich."}
{"text":"This location is small, don't count on a seat. I usually just stop for coffee on my way home, its good. I haven't really stay to observe but it's McDonald's. With that name you should know not to expect quality food but good value\n\nThen again I usually only stop for coffee and muffin at any location\n\nLike most small location that mostly serve for take out, the line are always messy. Not knowing who order and whi is just waiting"}
{"text":"I have stopped here in the past, for a MacDonald's the food is generally acceptable. Today I got the number 2. 2 cheeseburgers a fry and a drink. The fries were alright. The cheeseburgers were ok once you got past the dried buns that tasted like they had been out of the package for hours. I was there approximately noon. The parking lot was full but the dining room wasn't. It didn't take long to give my order or get my food. Unlike other reviewers i didn't use the bathroom but this is only the second McDonald's i have been in in the valley where they ration napkins. No napkin dispenser out where customers can get to them. Nice new fancy menu board. The owner very needs to put less time, effort and money into fancy high tech menu board and more into the basics.......like good fresh food. Better yet the owner should try his own food. Bet he won't care for it. Does make me wonder when was the last time he or she ate there."}
{"text":"It has to be probably the worst McD in the valley !! ( explains why I was empty )\nI come in to eat something real quick side I was still working. And well first they were out of little cups for ketchup. So when I tell the cashier he replies \" oh we don't use those anymore\" and gives done packages. Then I ask for a water cup and they don't have any or any water for customers. But said he would give some in a fountain drink cup. Which it was ok for me. And when  I wanted to use the  restroom well it gets interesting. They have it locked, of course !!\nAnd if you want to use it, you need to provide your receipt to show you are a customer and then they WALK you to the restroom as if you are going to steal the key or something. Omg what a weird and interesting visit to McD !! \nNever again. Really !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"No general issues, posted for wrong McDonalds originally."}
{"text":"What a slow ass drive through!!! How does this constitute fast food? Everytime I hit this McDonalds it's so slow....."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and literally will drive out of my way to go to a different location. I would have given it negative stars if possible."}
{"text":"As I live just one block North of this location, it's typical to find me in the drive-thru around 4-5pm nearly everyday. The quality of the food is always fantastic. The service...? Well. Not always great. Thadius was an enthusiastic young man. He always took care of me and with the kindest hospitality I've seen in fast food. He quit to pursue other things. Since he'd gone, my trips here had slimmed as the service is not really that good. That is until yesterday around 6pm. I was greeted at the speaker with the most effervescent, angelical voice I have ever heard. Clearly Gabby enjoys her job. Once I got to the window, she was just as enthusiastic as on the speaker. Her smile, shinning brighter than the sun, was just amazing. When I approached the 2nd window to receive my bag of delicious McTastieness, I asked to speak to the manager, who was also lively and hospitable. I spoke to her briefly about the need to, not only keep Gabby, but have Gabby train the others in the act of kindness and joy.  In terms of driving through, my experience was 5 star, however...\n\nMonday afternoon, (Memorial Day) I went inside. I am bowing my head in disbelief at the uncleanness that abounds. The dining room was filthy. There was a family in the play area. There was three homeless in various spots of the dining room sleeping slumped over tables. This doesn't include the half dozen homeless that was outside loitering in the parking lot. I found a relatively clean spot at their tall table in front of the absolutely filthy beverage counter The fountain drink area had a hand written sign indicating \"Out of Order.\" Though that wasn't true for all the fountain drinks, most of them didn't work. I had the Diet Dr. Pepper. It worked but was flat. That aside I was most disturbed by the lack of cleanliness in this place. \n\nI don't know what McDonalds policy is regarding the homeless, but this particular location seems to be a homeless magnet. Though my heart breaks for them and would love to see them catch a break, their presence here, I'm certain, drives away business. While enjoying my perfectly made, tasty triple cheese burger and well done fries, I witnessed several homeless men, (or so they appeared) walk up to the beverage counter with unbranded Styrofoam cups and helped them selves to a drink of their choosing. All the while the Manager and other crew members seemed to turn a blind eye to this seemingly petty crime. All that said, I regret I can only give 4 stars to this location."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I sit in the drive thru line. That should tell you how slow this place is.\nI had to sit here long enough to get pissed enough to write it and vent. We have now exceeded 10 minutes at 215pm on a Sunday. This place is always screwing up my order and is horribly slow. I don't know why I come back. It's a love/hate relationship. I love cheap good coffee and egg mcmuffins but hate screw ups, cold food and long waits. This McDonald's is nearby work so I suppose it's why I keep coming back for this crap. As I close this review, the food I got was cold, coffee burned and I got no receipt. But I'm sure my self loathing as* will be back. Ugh why do this  to myself"}
{"text":"There's nothing unique about the menu; this can be said about any McDonald's location. \n\nI like McDonald's for their coffee as I find it quite cheap (relatively) and good at the same time. \n\nThis location is closest to my house so I come here;  there's no point to travel 500 miles and 500 more for the golden arches. The staff here are really hardworking. It's always clean and the staff are efficient with a capital 'e.' There's a lot of parking both underground and on street level. A bonus would be the free newspaper at the counter. I always grab a coffee and the paper if I have time to go before work.\n\nIf you're in the area, drop by.\n\nYay, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"It's your standard McDonalds.  The only reason I wanted to write a review is because they did not clean up our table when we requested.  Which is fine when they're busy,  but we had waited to ask again when the rush died down and they still didn't come by.  \n\nIt's McDonalds,  not your cleanest of places but the table was unusually dirty and it had the only available power socket."}
{"text":"Not once would I ever have thought: McDonald's... A-OK. But... Consider the lobster. The McLobster. It's like America lost a bet and had to serve the McRib while Canada won and serves whole, fresh, chunks of lobster in lobster salad on a bun roll. Yes, here, while it may not be anything to write home about because it's old hat in Canada, it's a fresh catch for me to see it at McDonald's. This McDonald's... No drive thru. It's incredible to see people's reaction to no drive thru. The most easy going, active people might get enraged that we'd dare have to get out of the car. The nerve. But, during the McLobster season, it's no doubt worth it."}
{"text":"1/5 because this seems to be the only place that can screw up my coffee on more than one occasion.  Every time I ask for a coffee sugar some how ends up going in it."}
{"text":"Typical McDonald's in terms of food, however, this location is a lot slower than others. That can be a good thing since your food will be hot and fresh, but not so much if you're limited on time. They always get the orders right, which is a plus."}
{"text":"My most recent visit, has left me questioning the professionalism of this local establishment. During which, while Samara my cashier took my order, I observed two individuals in plain clothes walk behind the counter, passed her and three other employees, to what appeared to be the 1st drive thru window.\n\nWhether or not they are current employees bears no bearing to individuals walking through the kitchen who have no pressing business to do so. In the professional environment, perception is huge and this perception is not positive at all.\n\nAfter having gathered my food, and finished eating it, I observed a gentlemen place and pick up his order, walk towards the restrooms and turned around and placed his food on the counter to walk back to where the first two individuals went to. This lessened my experience that now three plain clothes individuals would casually walk behind the scenes (where my and other patron's food is prepared).\n\nOne star seems appropriate, but I'll give two assuming this was an isolated incident. Won't be going back for a while, though."}
{"text":"I don't really go to McDonald much so lately when I stopped to pick up my favorite No. 11 fish fillet meal that the meal has gotten smaller but the price is the same. I mean really a lot smaller."}
{"text":"It's really hard to write a review for a McDonalds because what the heck do you expect - it's a McDonalds, and yeah, some are better than others, but the thing that has caused McDonalds to be so popular isn't their service or their food - it's their consistency. You can walk into a McDonalds anywhere in the country and order a burger, and you pretty much know exactly what you're gonna get: Somebody behind the counter who's getting paid very little and is tired of dealing with idiot coworkers and idiot customers, and food that tastes ok but isn't healthy and isn't gonna win any Iron Chef competitions.\n\nSo what's the deal with this McDonalds? It's exactly what I described above: the average, generic burger joint you have come to expect.  Yeah, some days you're gonna walk in and somebody is going to give you an attitude, and sometimes your order will take longer than you want, and sometimes they'll screw up your order. If any of that surprises you, then allow me to be the first to welcome you to McDonalds."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service! I was asked if I would like a high five by the associate in the drive-thru! What a neat way to make people smile! The food was fresh, order was accurate and I was in/out of the drive-thru in 3 minutes!"}
{"text":"This location is really clean and has a really friendly staff... They have a cool area in the back that's kind of like a lounge pretty hip. They have free wifi  so get yourself a Big Mac and surf the internet for the calorie count."}
{"text":"This place always finds a way to mess up my order, I suggest going to a different location. Employees are always in bad moods also"}
{"text":"I have a relatively low level of expectation for a McDonalds, but this one sinks it. \n4 times I've been there recently, and in those 4 the have messed up every order. Simple things."}
{"text":"This is a so-so McDonald's location. The pluses are the location (right off of Chandler and 44th St), the giant play area for kids, and the large dining area. The minuses are that the parking lot is a pain, the drive thru is very slow, and the lot just feels kinda dirty. \n\nAt the end of the day it's all McDonald's food, so my rating is based on the experience, people, and feel of the location. And on this trip, the people seemed like they we're sleep-walking."}
{"text":"This Mc Donald's happens to be a hit and miss the majority of the time the food taste like its been under a heat lamp for hours."}
{"text":"Went to get a Sausage Egg McMuffin set with coffee. Drinking the coffee while driving and almost wrecked. There was a lot of coffee grounds in the dam cup. Even more was in my mouth Unacceptable!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Took a large group tonight.  There were 9 of us including kids.  The manager on duty was so completely rude and disrespectful to her employees that they literally appeared terrified.   The young man working the register seemed a bit new and nervous.  We placed a very complicated order with everyone special ordering their food.  He was patient and apologetic as he rang it all in.  The order on the receipt was 100% correct.  The food we got was 100% wrong.  When we went back to the counter the manager berated the cashier for a mistake that was NOT his!  I will be reporting this to owners right away."}
{"text":"I feel a bit weird even writing a review on McDonald's since it's, you know, McDonald's. I do expect good service and for my order to be correct. I was pretty hungry and looking forward to eating a big mac that I hoped would be fresh. Sometimes the food here tastes old. I finally made it home and I'm ready to eat but noticed they forgot my fries. I was a little annoyed but did not want to take another trip there besides they can make it up to me with the juicy big mac I'm about to eat. To my surprise the big mac was not dry because, wait for it, they DIDN'T put any meat patties on my sandwich. Yes you read that right, there was cheese, onions, special sauce and etc but NO MEAT. Wow - how does that happen? This isn't  the first time this location has messed up my order but they have reached a new low."}
{"text":"I usually go to the one in the foothills when I am working in Ahwatukee because it's nicer with friendlier employees. I take care of children for a living and they picked McD for their Friday treat. We go through the drive thru and the guy who takes my order is so soft spoken I can barely hear him. Polite but so soft spoken. I get to the window to get the 2 mcflurry's and 2 fries and one mcflurry is wrong. I politely ask the man to fix it and he does with no problem and I'm sitting there waiting and waiting and he finally says, \"oh you have fries too\" and hands me the bag. I have trouble figuring out why this location is super stingy with condiments but they can put 455 napkins in my tiny bag. The fries were also pretty old and stale. I know it's stereotypical to complain about McDonald's but I honestly never have a problem at the one right up the road. I am giving 2 stars because the staff was friendly. But everything else, 1 star was appropriate."}
{"text":"Is it a bit ridiculous to review a McDonalds?  After all, how high should one set their expectations for a fast food establishment anyway - and McDonalds is the poster child for the term \"Fast Food\".\n\nWe go to this restaurant for take out on occasion for convenience.  My expectations are set appropriately; 1) the food should be as indicated on the menu (unless modified, but we won't go there because \"special orders do upset us!\"), 2) the food should be warm and 3) they should have what the national chain advertises, however, as time would prove on multiple visits this is not so!\n\nSystematically, this McDonalds location has removed many products featured on the McDonalds national menu.  I suppose as a franchisee this is apparently their prerogative , nonetheless, frustrating when expecting something to be available to learn they don't offer it anymore.  This scenario has played out more than once in recent history.  I suspect the new All Day Breakfast has sent this location into a state of anxiety and their systems and processes to be able to deliver an Egg McMuffin at all business hours means they are unable to offer the Bacon or Chicken Clubhouse Burger (arguably the only item they have ever produced approaching a true restaurant quality product) or the Grilled Onion Cheddar Burger, and who knows what else may have fallen from the menu.\n\nFinally, and most important, this McDonalds does not seem to be able to create an order without flaws.  I would estimate that no less than 75% of my experiences at this restaurant result in some error, whether a prep error or a missing item.  \n\nThe management and staff of this McDonalds should walk across the street and pay Taco Bell for lessons (Taco Bell rarely messes up their orders, and when they do it's generally that they provide extra items at no charge).\n\nI must say, one area in which this location excels is consistency of non-performance!  And this attribute clearly permeates the culture at this store."}
{"text":"I ordered my food I was told I cannot have my cup until my meal was ready to be served to me. I even checked with management and he told me the same thing. What a disgraceful way to take care of customers. Too bad they don't have a half star."}
{"text":"Dirty place for a kids playground and restaurant . Asked the manager twice about cleaning the bathroom and no one came to clean it. Lazy attitude by the two employees I asked. I will not take my kids here again ."}
{"text":"Yay best 24/hour McDonalds around here! Plus having two drive through orders is awesome :)"}
{"text":"On the road traveling for work. I just wanted to comment how nice it was to have a smiling face to greet us in the morning. Thank you Kara (I hope I caught your name right). I was a tired, bumbling mess and had to keep adding to my order. We will definitely enjoy the coffee, tea, hash browns and oatmeal on the remainder of our trip. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I had very good service and food was complete and made as ordered. Much better than a McDonalds closer to my home. I'll drive the extra few minutes from now on."}
{"text":"sometimes the restrooms are a little dirty but everything else is great! :)"}
{"text":"4 stars for McDonald's? Am I nuts? Nope, by far the best one I've been to. 10:00 pm on Friday night they were able to serve us up food that was fresh and very hot fires."}
{"text":"I just live around the corner and every time I stop in they are so slow and the seem to have plenty of workers there. The last time I went inside no one was waiting on the people at the counter, one gentleman had to get someone's attention behind the counter so I went out to the drive thru and didn't have to wait at all. Better service for drive thru."}
{"text":"I could tell it was a Canadian McDonald's..............as it had Air Hockey in the kids play area!\nGotta love it.\nThey also had MX radio playing.\nA little Sade always adds to the devouring of a cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Avouons-le, nous avons tous envie d'un McDo de temps √† autre. Celui de Lachine est tr√®s bien entretenu et donne envie de rester sur les lieux pour manger. L'√©t√©, on peut √©galement aller faire une promenade sur le bord de l'eau qui est situ√© tout pr√®s."}
{"text":"It's McDonald's... and a 3-stars rating is as high as any franchise fast food restaurant can get.\n\nThe ambience is just GREAT. The place is very clean, and I really like how the place is decorated (with a fake fireplace and couches).\n\nMore importantly, the service is really fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Typical Mc.D's , ok service , unhealthy food that people enjoy on occassion. I ordered 20pcs of McNuggets and all I got was 1 BBQ sauce, do the math. Fries were cold and hard, just not a good day at Mc.D's"}
{"text":"Twice after midnight now I've had the same blonde girl with the same terrible attitude. It's the end of the world that she has to serve you. And don't ask for ketchup because she will hand you two as if it's being rationed. Zero customer service."}
{"text":"This is a 24hr mcdonalds which gives it the one star. Other than that the people who work there are incompetent. When you askfor a straw they can't even give it to you through drive thru. They simply forget the specifics and common sense of your order"}
{"text":"I don't really go to often here but if hunger strikes past 11pm in Oakville your options are pretty minimal to find a bite. I don't think I have to review the food since everyone knows the taste of McDonald, I only order one thing and one thing only and that is the BigMac. \nWhat still cracks me up with all the fast food places is the actual sandwich displayed on the picture and what you get in the box ( best explained in \"Falling Down\" ). Although I have to admit that the BigMac get's pretty close to what it looks like on there...."}
{"text":"this is a 24 hour Mick Dick's and is the closest to where I live. Definitely the place to go for late night munchies. \n\nI'm a big fan of the $1.39 menu or units as my friends and I refer to them as. Give me a junior chicken and a double cheeseburger over a big mac anyday."}
{"text":"If the Kiosk screws up your total $ to pay, the manager will lie through her teeth even though my receipt is OBVIOUSLY miscalculated.\n\nHer reasons were \"rounding.\" I know rounding, and we both know how much tax I'm supposed to pay.\n\nTurns out the kiosk didn't apply my coupon, even though it said it did. I don't mind the mistake, but the LYING MANAGER definitely crossed the line. I'm not coming back to this branch.\n\nFood: Normal McDonald's food, usual quality."}
{"text":"Prices here are outrageous for special orders. They charge a whopping $4.79 plus tax for a McDouble made \"like a mac\"--that burger costs only $1.69 made the regular way. The owner should be ashamed of themselves for ripping off customers like that."}
{"text":"Typical McDonald.  Busy at times.  I come here with the kids during weekends.  The play place is not crazy busy in the morning.\n\nSeating area is clean and open."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst location I have ever been too... And I have been to lots of McDonald's located all over the place...\n\n They can't get simple things right, and begrudge you of the things they do! This is damn McDonald's, why should they go out of their way to piss off their customers, EVERY VISIT!\n\nStay away from this location, it's not worth the time or headache!"}
{"text":"Good McDonald's location. Fast service, fresh food, polite staff. This is the place where I tried the \"12\" chicken sandwich. Strange name, unremarkable sandwich."}
{"text":"so recently i started visiting mcdonald's again. It seems to be a friendly place to grab a bite/coffee and read. sometimes the conversation around can get a bit loud to the point of distracting but that's mcdonalds. \n\ntip: the booth chairs are not as comfortable as they look."}
{"text":"This is not a good McDs. Almost always mess up your drive through order. Eating in is crazy slow regardless of whether they are busy or slow. Bought someone a happy meal today and asked for vinegar, which they said would cost 25 cents extra! What on earth are they thinking? Only saving grace... Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"It has Wi-Fi, play room for kids, Huge TV, drive thru and what's more important you can see me there time by time;)"}
{"text":"This location which is 24 hours now shuts down their drivethru with pylons before 12 am and now apparently closes all together. This has to be a joke right?"}
{"text":"Easily the worst McDonald's. I try to avoid McD's as a whole given superior options, said, I've had the misfortune of this location on 2-3 occasions, silly me for thinking it might get better. 1. I've had the pleasure of someone's order being processed incorrectly each time. 2. regardless of time this location is perpetually understaffed. 3. Ridiculous wait time (dine-in, take-out, order correction and drive-through) 4. Inability to find seating as the play-place is a zoo and loitering of tween and cheapskates spending a 1.25 on a drink to take up a booth and surf the web. I've taken to supporting alternatives in the area."}
{"text":"McDonald's offers a \"coffee\" card whereby if you buy 7 coffees,  the next one is free.   However,  at non-corporate stores such as this one,  they will not allow anything but a regular coffee if you use the card.   I buy the same coffee everytime I go to ANY location,  but this location always tries to charge me extra for the 'add vanilla syrup' option I choose.   The corporate advertising campaign shows the guy buying a basic coffee for his first 7, and when he gets his 8th (free coffee),  he orders a fancy coffee. \n\nToday,  once again,  the counter person (Crew Trainer) argued with me over the 'add vanilla syrup' option I choose. Simply put, I purchased 7 coffees exactly the same way and I should get my eighth free the same as I ordered the other 7.  Anyway,  they charge $0.30 for vanilla syrup and if you are lucky... You get 2 squirts of syrup.\n\nNOTE1:  As a manager or crew trainer,  you should never argue with a customer in front of other customers...\n\nNOTE2: Buyer beware\n\n Also,  an aside to this... Why is the exact same coffee 5 cents cheaper at some locations?"}
{"text":"Disgusting experience. After i got my take out bags i asked for some mayo and staff refused to give me some mayo. Like we are talking about a CONDIMENT. They wanted me to go back to the register and pay 25 cents for it. Like are you trying to win customer experience or just dont give a F about what that actually is?"}
{"text":"My kids and I met a friend and her kids here over the winter break. We went for an early lunch and the kids had a blast on the playscape. We were lucky to get a table because it got busy closer to noon. The service was amazing - staff were friendly and quick - the manager even brought our food to us. A great place to take kids!"}
{"text":"For a McDonald's that is this busy, the service is incredibly slow. I came here for lunch with a coworker and it was nearly impossible to get a seat for all the kids just hanging around. If you're looking to come here, I strongly suggest it's after the lunch rush. This location is not equip to handle that many customers. Apart from that, the food was typical of any other McDonald's and our order was accurate even though my coworker had a 'made-to-order' Big Mac... so maybe an extra .5 star for that."}
{"text":"I go to this McDonalds often for breakfasts. I have no clue why the reviews are low. This is one of the cleanest and most efficiently run McDonalds I have been to. I've been to a bunch! Great and kind staff. Quick service and fast turn over of food. It seems like a very well managed establishment. It has been part of my morning routine when I'm in a rush in the morning during a long commute. I have relied on this McDonalds for over two weeks. Not sure what happens at dinner time but afternoons and breakfast are great!! So I would reconsider the poor reviews here. This McDonalds is a good one!"}
{"text":"The Sunday morning staff here don't seem to be aware they have the biscuit item on their menu, despite it being a featured menu item right behind their little heads. Twice I've been here and twice I've ordered a bacon 'n' egg biscuit and twice they've tried to give me a bacon and egg McMuffin. The first time, I didn't notice until I got to my table. I had waited so bloody long in line and then so bloody long for my food, I didn't want to waste another 20 minutes waiting for them to get a simple order right.\n\nToday I tried it again and again they rang me up for a McMuffin. Son of a bitch. Luckily I was primed and noted I actually ordered the biscuit and not the McMuffin. \n\nAnyway, the place does pretty brisk Sunday morning trade. Verifying your order before heading to your table."}
{"text":"Someone just wrote me a note to say that I didn't make a profit. No.... I didn't.... the review should've read. McDonald's wasted my time and kept my money which resulted in McDonald's making the profit!!!"}
{"text":"15 minutes after I ordered in the drive thru my car hasn't moved...I think that pretty much is all you need to know for this review as I am writing in FROM the drive thru!"}
{"text":"The parking lot was clean. Front door is by the stinky dumpster. The dining room floor felt greasy. The service was friendly and fast. The food was hot (great eating temp). I had breakfast, a no.1 egg mcmuffin meal, hashbrown with oj, it was the usual McDonald's taste."}
{"text":"We've eaten here lots of time as it's the closest McD's to my grandmother's neighborhood.\n\nThey're usually pretty much on point but my most recent visit was a real bummer. \n\nI detest the drive thru because it seems to be the dumping ground for cold fries and incorrect sandwich orders.\n\nSadly, my experience last week fell along these lines.\n\nI ordered a double filet meal without tartar sauce and another meal for my daughter.\n\nIt's a good thing I checked my purchase before I exited the parking lot. The double filet I paid for had morphed into a single filet with no cheese.\n\nWhich meant I had to get out of my car and go into the place, defeating the purpose of the drive thru and pretty much ensuring cold fries by the time I reached my destination.\n\nThe only thing that could have ticked me off more would have been to find the single filet upon arriving home.\n\nSo I went in with the filet AND the fries and asked for hot fries to accompany my new sandwich. While I waited, I observed the workers. \n\nI saw one young lady accidentally knock a bag (from the stack of new bags), onto the floor. \n\nWhen I saw her pick it up and place it back on top of the clean bags (Can anyone say \"cross contamination\"?), I called a manager over and told him.\n\nHe was curt but he found the offending bag and put it in the trash.\n\nHowever, the bag beneath it should have been tossed as well because the bag that had fallen on the floor was placed dirty side down onto it.\n\nAnd in keeping with my notion of good sanitation, both people who touched the dirty bag should have washed their hands after.\n\nTo her credit, another manager asked what was going on and she reprimanded the young lady firmly but nicely.\n\nBut still, I didn't see anyone wash their hands.\n\nMaybe it's time for me to stop eating out."}
{"text":"Waited in line for 10 minutes, only to be told the ice cream machine is down for cleaning. This machine must be the cleanest one ever. It's always down doesn't matter what time you come here after 8pm. 2am after the bar, it's being cleaned. So how long does it take to clean it? And why don't they use some of that time to clean the dirty bathrooms and lobby."}
{"text":"They can't make a cup of coffee to save their lives. 4 strikes on one ice coffee. Asked for coffee not a cup of cream or sugar water. Coffee sweetened with cream. Coffee is the main ingredient not the other way around. Not the first time this has happened. Ordered a latte here received a cup of hot milk. They forgot the expresso all together. Next time I changed it up and ask for a coffee black. They gave it to me with cream and sugar."}
{"text":"this has to be the worst mcdonalds ever . i cant believe i am doing a review on a fast food chains but i tried to give it a chance. The staff is extremely rude and slow.  i wait 18 min for my food. food was cold missing food and the  pie seem like it was 2 days old also I had hair on my cheeseburger.  Beware travel 3 miles up to the northlake locations."}
{"text":"Zero stars out of everything i ordered at 10 on a friday. Screw this place worst fastfood in the area"}
{"text":"I've only been through the drive thru,  but I've visited pretty frequently. It's almost always the same staff in the morning, and they're always smiling (nice to see in the early hours). I've only had the wrong order once of the zillion times I've stopped by. The credit card machine was down once, but it happens.\n\nIt's mcdonalds. If all you can really ask is to get what you want from someone who at least seems happy to help you, then these guys are doing their job!"}
{"text":"This  place continues to go downhill.   They constantly get food orders wrong,  they are out of items,  most of the employees seem to just not care.   I am done with this place.   I like McDonald's but avoid this particular one like the plague.   \n\nI have called at least three times and complained and nothing has changed."}
{"text":"First I pull up to the right window and they serve the left side instead even though I was first. Then my person took forever taking my order that another 2 people went through on the other window. when I was done ordering she said is that all and I said yes then nothing. No confirmation screen no total no please pull forward. She never came back so I just took off. I was like hello?  Did you get that?  You there?  McDonald's?  quarter pounder?  If you can't handle operating 2 drive thrus. Stick to one until you get it figured out. OR hire people with some kind of skill. It's not that difficult to take an order now."}
{"text":"I'd say this is the worst McDonalds in the world, but that would not cover it enough. This is quite possibly the worst establishment on earth. Every time I've ever been here I've had something to wrong. From terrible to service to getting orders wrong, if it can be messed up, they will find a way. Today I stood at the register for 5 minutes, knowing full and well what I wanted, waiting for someone to take my order. If i wanted to wait ten minutes for my meal, I would've gone to an actual restaurant. I walked out, taking my business to the Wendy's down the street, where someone was WAITING at the cash register. What a novel idea. 0/10, will avoid at all costs..."}
{"text":"Every time that I go here the line is SUPER long. Even on the inside. Today I went to the drive through to order some food I waited for like 4 mins as someone pulled up in the second entrance and they were immediately greeted which I thought was strange since I had been waiting I continue to wait as the other car pulled around and still no one greeted me so I went to drive to the window and when I get there the woman says \"what can u help you with baby\" well I waited in the line and you got the person ahead of me . So I gave her my order and as I was giving my order she said hold on sweetie and then I went to ask if the first speaker was broken and the so called looking manager counting the employees draw down goes she's working both lanes and taking money .. I thought she came off extremely rude because the point of a drive through is to be a quick process of one person can't handle it then maybe you need some assist so out someone else on there . If she was nicer I would have stayed in line and blew it off but no I took my business else where . Step up the customer service and number of staff if u can't handle it please"}
{"text":"Their card machine is almost always \"broken\" so they only accept cash. The fries always come out soggy and the service is so slow it's faster to go next door to Wendy's. I come here a lot because I live really close and there is no way their card machine is broken that frequently."}
{"text":"My egg mcmuffin was covered in mold and the cheese was slimy. Don't go here, there's Wendy's next door."}
{"text":"They don't have the combo with two sausage egg mcmuffins. I wake up, on Easter, go and think I'll have a delightful fast food breakfast, drive around in an unfamiliar city, finally make it to those golden arches and into the drive thru and what do I get? My dreams crushed. My soul shattered. Needless to say if I'm in Phoenix again I will NOT be coming here for nourishment."}
{"text":"Cashier was rude and annoying, cold French fries ketchup dispenser broken an idiot dropped soda all over the floor and none off the staff is out cleaning it. It takes one locating like this one to rewind a franchise"}
{"text":"Avoid this McDonald's they have their food on standby for many hours. It's disgusting and cold. Last time I got food poison from eating here ! Also they forget to give items on drive through .. there was a time I had to go back to drive though simply cuz they didn't fulfill my order"}
{"text":"I mean I know it's McDonalds but for the third night in a row their ice cream machine was down. Fortunately Wendy's next door was open and there's does work"}
{"text":"I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one. By the time I get to the register it's 10:30 and I am told I can't order breakfast even though I was in line before 10:30. The cashier let me order breakfast anyway - all I want is a McMuffin - and I proceed to wait twenty minutes to even get my order. I might have been able to forgive this considering there were two huge orders ahead of mine (Easter breakfast for the whole family, I guess) except my McMuffin was soggy, and my iced coffee was so stale I couldn't taste the flavored syrup in it. Worst of all, even after I got my food, I still had to wait for my coffee, because they had decided to make coffee for other orders first. You can be sure I will do my very best to never come here again."}
{"text":"Went through here tonight and I was told that I had to pay cash. 12am. Asked for a recipe and they said they couldn't produce one. Sounds to me like someone is stealing cash. How do you not think someone's going to notice that credit cards were not used all night? Not to mention the fact that the amount of food is missing. Criminals these days are not to bright. Lady I do wish all the best on your theft."}
{"text":"The staff is nice. But the location isn't the best. Driving into the parking lot to get to drive thru is narrow and sometimes the cars backing out don't pay attention. It's not a big parking lot so sometimes the line can be out to the street. The only thing that isn't the best here."}
{"text":"Has got to be the worse mcdonalds I have ever been too. I thought all the other reviews were just being mean, but they're right. I walked in at 1:20pm on a Thursday. There was one family waiting for ice cream cones but other than that, no one else was in line or near the counter. I watched as the cashier got the ice cream cones made and handed to the kids and even when she looked at me and I smiled at her, she still did not return the smile or greet me. There was another worker bagging drive thru food and another employee sweeping the floor. All of them looked directly at me. Not one of them greeted. \nI waited for 10 minutes WITH NO ONE ELSE IN LINE before I finally was asked what I wanted. They were all talking to each other and joking around with the cooks about nonsense. \nI finally got my drink, the soda was flat, and when I got my food, the buns were stale and the fried were old and cold. \nThe seats were falling apart. The booth I sat in moved every time the teen on the other side of it moved. They then made it a game and continued to move it and laugh about it with their friends. One woman sat in another booth next to mine and the seat nearly collapsed to the ground because of how unstable it was. \nI was just looking for cheap dollar menu before work but this wasn't even worth the dollar."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst McDonalds I have ever been to they are extremely slow even during the middle of the night, after midnight they seem to never be able to do any transactions other than debit card and most not all of the staff are rude.  I keep going hoping that maybe they mad some type of miraculous change in staff and pace but of course I am always let down.... I am typing this as I wait for my chicken nuggets"}
{"text":"This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to and it's surprising how bad it is. Their sweet tea taste like sewer water and it's not even sweet. I can't even finish the drink! Had to toss it. Their fries are not salty whatsoever and it's so dry. Never again."}
{"text":"Typical busy night at a downtown Toronto McDonalds. Loads of inebriated people just looking for a quick bite.\n\nFrom what I remember, the food were ordered was hot and as fresh as possible ;)\n\nWas a bit creeped out by the man passed out inside of his t shirt at the table beside us, but he was just minding his own business and having a kitten nap.\n\nThanks Mickey D's!!"}
{"text":"I bought a burger and im so upset because my entire order was not right. I asked for a double cheese burger with 5 slices of pickles, 2 mayo packets, extra lettuce and a slice of tomatoe on it. With half oreo mc flurry and half smarties, med. Fry with a slice of melted cheese on them, and 10 chicken nuggets. (my usual order) i mean its a lot but its not that hard. And they gave me a chicken wrap and a ice cream cone? Then when i complained and they made my order \"the right way\" the burger was cold and i found a hair. I wouldnt come back if i was being paid."}
{"text":"After not getting into Sneaky Dee's we ventured down to McDonald's to prolong the time until she inevitably would barf (and then I would subsequently barf because the smell of barf is just the worst). \n\nThough she was unable to determine for the bouncer how many drinks she had had, she was able to promptly order a giant mcFlurry and use her debit to pay for it and have me eat half of it, also a cheeseburger. She may have tried to start a fight with a group of teens I can't really remember. \n\nEveryone at McDonald's is so nice. I feel like I have made life long friends. I also slipped on ice outside here one time and that was PRETTY EMBARRASSING."}
{"text":"The staff here (especially the tall one) are extremely judgmental.  I'm sorry I burped okay?  OKAY???  It's not my fault the bourbon occasionally repeats on me.  Also, it's not my responsibility to remember when shamrock shakes \"are\" and \"are not\" available.  I mean Jesus Christ... Maybe if you HAD a minty shake available more often, your PAYING CUSTOMER's accidental burps would not seem so offensive to your upturned noses.  1 star only for the excellent filet o' fish, which I quite enjoyed."}
{"text":"Dear McDonald's,\n\nI know you're not good for me. Actually, we ALL know you're bad for us .. but why, are you so f-ing good?!\n\nYou're especially tempting on those Sunday afternoons, when I don't feel like cooking. That's when you're really tasty. Especially after smoking a big fat bowl ... mmm ... \n\nI try to stay away from you.\nIt's your smell. It's the way you give me the same food, every single time. It's never a surprise, and I'm never really disappointed. Every so often your fries are soggy and gross, but I forgive you. The sauce oozing out of my McChicken makes me forget how crappy your fries are.\n\nI wish you'd stop sending me those '2 can dine for $8.99' coupons in the mail. They make me angry, and I feel bad for the environment, so I always keep your coupons .. and sometimes even end up using them. So for that, I hate you, and your strategic marketing campaigns. It's like you *know* when I'm eating well and exercising regularly, as that's when you come out tempt me ... \n\nI will probably see you in a couple of weeks, so with that, I look forward to our next encounter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nL.\nPS. I love you especially at this location, because you don't make me move my lazy ass to get my food - i just reach out the window."}
{"text":"I love this location for one reason: DRIVE THRU!  And not only that, the most whack drive thru of all time.  I have nearly crashed my car into the menu, the speaker, the yellow poles that are supposed to keep you from crashing into the wall, the wall, the drive thru andd potentially the Ronald McDonald Foundation's plastic change collectors located beneath the drive thru window.\n\nThe set up is terrible but it is so convenient.  Especially when you're a McDonald's addict like me.  During rainstorms I have driven over from Yorkville...yes, I am that person.  Sometimes I just want my McDonald's and I want it immediately if not sooner.  This location always makes it sooner.  Please note, I have never been inside."}
{"text":"Yep! It's a McDonald's. In spite of their best efforts to create the most uncomfortable seating arrangements possible, this McDonald's attracts all morning visits from those who can afford to purchase a senior coffee and need a place to hang out.\n\nIf you do find a seat, you will likely have to move your feet for a broom or cover your mouth while some spray cleaner is being used right by you.\n\nAnother difficulty here is the ordering layout. There is simply not enough room for those waiting to order and those waiting on food-the layout is wonky.\n\nFinal gripe- it is tough to navigate the uncharges for things like a small soft drink instead of a coffee with breakfast combos, or similar challenges discerning what might be a 2$ summer drink special in a small size, but a 3.89 charge in a medium. They don't try to help you. And no, it won't be debit, it is credit!\n\n\nOnce you get past these challenges, the management here seems to try to connect with customers and manage the chaos. In several visits the fries have been hot, as have the burgers."}
{"text":"This is one of the few McDonald's restaurants in Toronto with a drive-thru. As such, I often end up here as a drunk passenger or, embarassingly, a completely sober driver in need of some nuggets. Don't judge me.\n\nThe drive-thru is a throwback to days of yore when they employed two separate windows: one for payment and the other for food delivery. And more than that, it sucks. The angles are treacherous, and if you're in a vehicle larger than a Smart Car, your fenders and paint job are at risk. It's like wearing a greased up wetsuit and clambering through a heating duct. It requires surgical precision to successfully navigate this pick up window, and when I have a violent McCraving I can't be blamed if I blast through a building facade in an SUV.\n\nI highly recommend the hot mustard sauce.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: McNUGGET of wisdom: walk in instead.\n\nMenu Readability: I find the drive-thru menu really confrontational. \n\nNeed to mention: Why do they spell it \"thru\" and not \"through\"? How has no one called them on this?\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I am so glad I don't own a car."}
{"text":"As a person who enjoys a drink in the afternoon, the first thing which struck me was the lack of single malts at this restaurant.  The second thing which struck me was the lack of any alcohol whatsoever.  I turned and walked out.  For shame gentlemen!"}
{"text":"McDonald's is my favorite restaurant in the world. Not ashamed of that, either. \n\nThe experiences at this location, hands down over the last 2 years, have been consistently poor. It's not where it physically is, the parking, the food, it is...the staff. They are awful. \n\nI keep coming back- because it has drivethru. Its almost comical how poor a handle of the English language each person on the intercom. \n\nThis is the only location I've been to that requires 6x as long to place an order, and 1/3 times, the order is wrong. Never drive away until you check the bag. \n\nManagement at this location needs to spend less money on renovations and more on better hiring practices."}
{"text":"This location purposely serves ruined/spoiled burgers.\n\nThey have repeatedly served burgers that were clearly kept on the grill way past when they were supposed to be thrown out, burgers that are dry and chewy and taste like cardboard.\n\nDon't go here."}
{"text":"Not too bad as far as customer service goes. I've been here plenty of times in the morning before work. They greet you with a smile and just give you a positive feeling. Which is refreshing since you're heading into work. \n\nSo the morning crew A+"}
{"text":"If I could put zero stars I would ... We just waited 20 minutes for 3 ice cream cones. One would imagine that the people in front of us ordered the entire menu. But they only ordered a chicken nugget meal. And the worker forgot to give them their drink so they had to knock on the drive through window several times to get his attention to ask for their drink. He then took 5 more minutes to get the drink, the one drink. When we finally pulled up to the window we asked what the issue was and the worker said that chicken nuggets take a long time. Lol I have never waited that long at McDonald's in my entire life, let alone the times I've ordered chicken nuggets. \nThen the kid hands us our comes, all dripping and hunched over looking like absolute garbage. Not acceptable. I wouldn't even pay for it and just left had we not already waited so very long. It's 11:40pm on a Saturday night I get it, but you want $15/HR ?! Give me a break. Yeah right."}
{"text":"Quick and easy drive thru. Prices at McDonald's are so good considering it's so bad for you. This location is right off the freeway for easy access."}
{"text":"Kind of annoyed with them! I ordered an Oreo mcflurry with hot fudge \nPaid for my ice cream but no hot fudge on it \nAsked for and was told they were out"}
{"text":"Okay, so I guess it's just the night crew or something, but I came on Sunday mid morning  for a quick meal and they were awesome! Much better than last time."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst McD's around. They are slow service, back up easily, half the time screw up the order and some crew members are pretty rude (considering what their job is to serve). Not to mention they have the open late sign but constantly shut down early at night. Forget the late night ice cream run... Wawawahhhh!"}
{"text":"I basically order an egg biscuit sandwich and a diet Dr. Pepper when I don't have time to prepare breakfast at home. The food tastes great but unless you're in the drive thru you can expect a longer wait. I don't go thru the drive thru because I just spent $73 on gas this morning and I don't need to burn any extra gas while waiting in line. Plus, sometimes the diet Dr. Pepper tastes a little funky unless you let the soda that's been sitting in \"the tubes\" OVERNIGHT run for awhile before putting your cup under the dispenser. And as of today, I guess they don't give napkins with your to go order when you order inside.\n\nI suggest this McDonald's gets a little bit more wo(man) power during the morning rush to service the customers in a more timely manner."}
{"text":"My first two visits to this place was not good.  (Backround: My first job was working in a McDonald's restaurant in another state, so i know how a good burger should taste like)\n\n\n First week: i order a BLT Crispy chicken sandwich at the driver thru.    I get to the window and the cashier had me pull up to the waiting area due to the fact that it takes a 5 minutes to fry the chicken piece.  So i wait for almost 13 minutes.  I then park my vehicle and i was about to walk in and get my money back when my food finally arrives.  \n   When i get to my work site, i eat my sandwich and the chicken is WAY overcooked.  I called their complaint dept. number listed on the receipt.\n\n 2nd week: i order a Bacon& cheese Snack wrap. Instead i get the deluxe snack wrap.   \n\nI called their complaint line twice and i got no response to my complaints. \n\n\nSometime soon i will try to order from this location again and see if they corrected their flaws\n\n This all took place 5 months ago so maybe they have a new manager now that actually knows how to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Thy did get my order incorrect.  I went the next day told them and thy gve me my order for free.  And thy were quick"}
{"text":"I thought this place was getting better as I've been there a couple times and service seemed to be good. Today proved to me once again wrong. The drive-through people were cocky and unattentative and really could've cared less. Got home my order was incorrect once again I'm done!!!!  I have to give one star else it would be zero"}
{"text":"Not the best McD's in town. Almost every time I go here, something doesn't go right.  Whether it's a frapp that isn't thoroughly blended (ice chunks in it), or slow service, or someone very incoherent on the drive thru speaker, it seems to always be lacking in consistency and good service as a norm."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time this has happened to me. The first time I was like, it's a dime I will let it go. That was a while ago. The 2nd time I was like, it's a dime, obviously this problem hasn't been resolved, I wonder how many customers McDonalds serves in a day and pay in cash and are being short changed a dime. Seems like a lot of money is being stolen from their customer 1 dime at a time Not Cool!!! Where are all those dimes going?????"}
{"text":"Pretty standard McDonald's.  I usually get the right order and no problems, but last time they forgot one of my sausage McMuffins.  Bastards! It's okay.  I forgive you McDonald's.  Just don't let it happen again or I'll take my business elsewhere... wait, where else can you get a $1 sausage McMuffin?  Damn McMuffin monopoly!"}
{"text":"Updating my review after several weeks. Appears maybe the managers read these reviews. In the last few weeks this store has improved 2 stars. The eggs in my BBs have been cooked perfectly, Diet Coke tastes better and they have not forgotten anything in all my visits. Added two stars because they have been consistently 5 stars since my last review...but I am still watching."}
{"text":"Simple order, hot & spicy, fresh order of fries, and Dr Pepper. *fresh fries are my favorite instead I got the oldest fries ever. All soggy I get it it's fast food but c'mon."}
{"text":"I hate coming here. I think they have new management or something because everyone who was there before isn't. They never get the order right. The drive thru has lines all the way out to the street. The place inside is disgusting. I'm surprised they've managed to keep that 'A' grade. The play place is so filthy, and it smells. I get it, it's where kids play, but shit clean it up. \nThe girl who takes your order inside or at the drive thru has an attitude problem. The one that hands you the food has an attitude problem. Then they get mad when you ask for an extra condiment. As if it came out of their pay check. I can't wait for the other one to open up down the street. I rather make the drive. Get it together."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst McDonald's I have ever been to. Ghetto drive through associate. The soda fountains are so dirty they don't taste like soda. No salt on the fries and the burger taste like it was cooked two hours ago. They have to be intentionally working at being this bad."}
{"text":"This is the slowest drive-thru ever. This is crazy they cannot even get my child's food right, come on people. I need to convince my child to stop eating this food. Its not good for her growing body. Never again am I coming to this location, ever.\nSlow and everything was wrong."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Mc D's. Trash is everywhere inside and outside. The kitchen was so messy and floor was disgusting. This is unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Foolishly came here again for breakfast wound up returning a hasbrown that tasted like a grease sponge I explain it to the drive through associate and ms bad attitude explains to me the hasbrown taste bad because the grease is old giving me a what do you want me to do about it look , heaven forbid she change it herself."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad, after the other reviews I was worried. Food was hot, except the hash browns, and the order was right.\n The Carmel Frappe was really good.\n Sat in the Kids Place, because the other side was freezing, after wiping the table it wasn't bad.\n All in all, meh. Not great not awful, typical."}
{"text":"Super slow!!! Been here 6x and they never get my order right!!! Will never come back here! I always ordered well done fries and I always get saggy fries that probably been sitting around for more than an hour. ~__~ I went to go to drive thru and the lady told me to wait 10 minutes at front parking lot 18minutes later still nothing so I decided to go drive at the drive thru. The lady told me to go back to the front and wait 10 minutes I told her I've been waiting for 18 minutes. They so slow!!! And probably not even doing their job. I own the business across the street and they always waste my time. Today, I asked for that Oreo mcflurry I think and they said \"Yes\" they have some so it's cool, then when I went to pay, they told me \"I'm sorry we don't have some at the moment and we will refund your money and you can take the rest of your order at the 2nd window\" ~__~ whoever the manager here for sure doesn't know how to manage. I hope mcdonalds pay attention to this location. They need better people inside!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service ! The guy in the drive thru I believe his name was Roberto was amazing and very helpful. He made the experience better than what the  reviews say."}
{"text":"Always out of stock of everything and slow service all the time. They get my orders wrong every time. I ordered sweet tea and it wasn't even sweet."}
{"text":"Does not even deserve any stars ive been waiting in line in drive through for 30 min to get a orange juice and a breakfast sandwhich  couldnt even leave i was blocked in and parking lot was empty  these people take their time never  coming her again if your looking for fast service  go elsewhere  and orange juice was half way couldnt even ask for more because the lady with the glasses shut the window so fast we didnt want to wait any longer"}
{"text":"Seriously terrible the service is lousy and the employees are incompetent and rude and I don't know why but it seems like in the evening you cannot get a strawberry cream pie or a McFlurry. do not stop there late in the evening. its for one of those two items and I can't get either of them after 11 at night it doesn't make any sense plus you talk about the incompetence of the employees what a bunch of idiots not a single one of them has finished middle school alone high school"}
{"text":"I'm doing this review as I'm in the drive thru and I've been waiting for 20 minutes already I'm going to be late for work. Seriously how long does it take to get an order this is insane. This is seriously the worst McDonalds EVER!!!!! This is an everyday thing even for after breakfast hours. They need new management or crew I don't know but this place has to go."}
{"text":"Purchased a yogurt paffait with expired date on sticker.  What was worse was it was only 2/3 full with no blueberries.  I called and talked to manager, but it took a while for her to understand she sold me an expired item and without blueberries.   I called back later and talked to the store manager to express my concern:  are blueberries being recycled when paffait itself expired?  He said no, and said \"oh, we were out of blueberries.\"   He offered me a free dinner, which I declined and said at most I want is refund other than express my concerns.  As he was very persistent, I agreed to accept a free meal.  He said it was to make up for my bad experience.  He said he won't be there, but will let the manager know.  As I don't feel comfortable eating there, my coworker suggested to get a voucher.  When I went to return the item after work,  shift manager just gave me a look, and another employee came and gave me a refund saying, \"I was told,  food you get, you have to eat here, and don't take outside.\"  I never even mentioned her about a free meal.   I just told her, \"No, thank you, I don't feel comfortable eating here,\" and left.  Store manager made my bad experience a worst one for sure.  I don't think they care about food safety or customer service.  Not coming back ever again."}
{"text":"the bastards put coffee grounds into my wifes McDouble. I hope i catch them in action doing this. Im calling the health dept. the next business day. Also extremely ghetto looking employees. They should close this location down or start from scratch with the employees"}
{"text":"Been going here for years.  Always odered   2 big macs and 2 hot and spiceys with large fries with sweat tea and a diet coke.   Good service.   Sometimes they forget to give your soda cup, but overall is good."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst McDonald's that I have ever been why do they have a 24 hour drive thru if every time you pass by they never have any food. And I'm not the only one that has had that issue a couple of my friends had the same issue. They shouldn't open 24 hours other than refusing for service. And whenever you dine in the place is always dirty thank god that there's another McDonald's right next to the 95 and Jones."}
{"text":"crappy mcdonalds,as if there's ever a good one. .first the guy couldn't hear us over the speaker so we had to wait to order and there was only one car in front of us and that took 10mins. and when we get to the window the guy can't even take our order right? 2 Carmel iced coffees 3 pies & a large order of fries.The guy even asked me if I said Vanilla -_- \n\nWe ended up paying for 3 iced coffees and the fries. .it took a while and then he handed us the coffee first and looked at us in a way as if he knew that was wrong.and then I was like we had the pies and fries? and then he was gave i us the fries and we were like okay wait wtf,where is the receipt.(which we never received)  he took our order wrong.didnt bother to try to fix it,and just said sorry about that. ."}
{"text":"Service industry people take note !\n\nSuper friendly service . We wanted a Mc Flurry but they were cleaning the machine so we couldn't get one . They gave us a free pie to make up for it and apologized . We didn't need the free pie but the sincere apology was super nice . \n\nClean restaurant , lobby open till 11."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW REFERS TO THE MICK DICK'S AT 386 BAGLEY RD IN BEREA, MEA CULPA. I went through a period of almost 23 without stepping into one of these shit shacks, but in my current situation-caring for 2 disabled women and being the runner at work-I'm FORCED to go to Micky-Dicks on occasion, that is to say I WAS forced to go, but never again. I went to get breakfast for the folks at work and tried to pay with $100 bill and was totally refused, no ifs, ands or buts. I went to Burger King, where I was served happily while using the bill. I called the corporate office because I'd been told by a banker that it was not legal to refuse any coin of the realm for the satisfaction of a debt. Corporate called the owner about the situation who in turn, called me and left a message. She said it was her policy not to take the bills because they had gotten 3 counterfeits and there was no way to recoup the loss. (With all the new watermarks, holograms and special paper used it is impossible to counterfeit this bill. The old bills, yes, can easily be counterfeited, but there's the marker that can be used to determine whether the paper is the special, government bond or not. And I'm the one inconvenienced because the retro-grade morons who work there can't handle a marker.) While leaving the message for me the owner allowed that I \"might have had\" a real bill, but it was her policy to not accept them. I \"MIGHT HAVE HAD\" implies that she thinks I'm trying to pass a bad bill, and for that I say to her GO FUCK YOURSELF, AND DO IT TODAY. Things are more expensive these days and many are carrying larger bills so their wallets aren't crammed full. Hell, Mick Dicks' slogan years ago was Mick Dick's \"gives you change back from your dollar.\" Now you're lucky to get change back from your $20. I was using the drive-through and as soon as the woman saw the $100 bill I no longer existed, same with management. And so, for your purposes I no longer exist, there are plenty of places that WILL accept the bill, and with a smile. As I said, I went for 23 years without eating their poison (last time was in Marion, Ohio when they had a nice, julienne chef salad) and I think I'll easily be able to avoid going to ANY Mick Dick's for the rest of my life; after all, there are plenty of food places that don't promote obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease."}
{"text":"I don't know why this McDonalds doesn't pop up when I do a search for McDonald's.  Regardless it is conveniently close to the Courtyard by Marriott where'd we stayed.  The restaurant looked like it was newly renovated, and when we went at 6:45am, it was not crowded at all and service was prompt."}
{"text":"So, typically after a movie my best friend and I go to a fast food joint just to get a quick bite to eat. We decided to stop at this McDonald's because it was the closest.  The building is new it has been remodeled in the past few years and still looked nice inside.  I ordered just a burger and drink.  I went and got my drink (ice and Hi-C Orange) and I decided not to put a lid on.  I ALWAYS put a lid on but for some reason I just didn't last night.  After I ate my burger I went to take a sip and I looked in my cup and saw nasty white stuff floating inside all the way down and floating on top.  It was revolting!  I refused to drink that.. How the hell was I supposed to know what it was?!  So I went up to the counter to show them and ask for a new cup.  I explained I had white stuff floating in my drink and several workers began laughing.  Not one person apologized to me and acted put out when I asked for a new cup.  They were rude teenagers and very unprofessional.  I am going to be calling Corporate and reporting this.  Food was decent and hot.. But due to the unknown substance in my cup that will prevent me from EVER coming back here.  The workers was extremely rude.  That also is a big factor.\n\nStay away.. Unless you like being treated like crap and you enjoy white floaties in your drink.\n\n***EDITED:  I emailed a complaint about my experience and the owner of this McDonald's herself personally called me that night.  She was extremely upset and offered her sincere apologies. Also sent me a gift card and pulled up video/audio to see who it was that acted so wrongly.  I am very pleased that she took these matters into her own hands and just for that reasoning alone I am willing to give this specific McD's one more shot! **"}
{"text":"It is what it is, a McDonalds.  You get what you expect.  Inexpensive fast food.  They do have a value menu.  I do like the fries."}
{"text":"Going to McDonalds I don't expect much.  The food for the most part is disgusting, but you expect that so that isn't what I'm giving this location one star.  \n\nI recently decided to order some chicken nuggets so I pulled up to the drive thru and was enthusiastically greeted with \"what do you want\" by the seemingly happy employee.  I placed my order and pulled ahead in line.  As I made my way to the second window the employees were apparently having a party because no one was distributing the bags of food that were sitting on the counter getting cold.  Finally after ten minutes I was given my food from one of the bags sitting on the counter and I joyfully pulled away.  Upon opening my bag I noticed I wasn't given a straw.  More importantly though I was given random food and nothing even closely resembling my order.  At least they gave me napkins.  \n\nI have been to this location a few times and would not recommend it to anyone.  There are a number of other McDonalds location up the road in Murrysville and Plum.  I would recommend this location to any drug addicts looking for somewhere quiet to OD because it would take a week for anyone to even realize you were there."}
{"text":"I am seriously done giving my money to this mcd. Today was the last chance they had. This morning I went for breakfast through their drive through. There were 3 cars in front of me. One picking up their order, one paying, and one ordering. When it was my time to order they didn't greet. I waited thinking they were helping the person at the window where you pay.. After a few I said \"hello?\" And no response. A car behind left because of the waiting. I was never acknowledged to even give them a second just as some places would let me know they know I'm there. I could hear the girl talking because apparently she never turned off her piece. I waited a total of 7 minutes until I decided it was enough! No one took my order, the three cars in front of me were long gone and nothing. I was so mad that I just drove away and as I passed by the window I just saw the girl standing there. She saw me drive away too! This McDonald needs to better train their employees or new management. They've gotten my order wrong several times and they even don't know what I order even after I paid for it. And aside from that, they are slow. They talk a lot instead of doing their work. Less talk more work! Never going there again!"}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly. Clean except the last person in the men's room hit everything but the toilet. \n\nOther than that, as good as most and better than many. I don't rate food quality at fast food unless exceptional. You don't go here for quality... You go to McDonald's for fast filler food"}
{"text":"There is nothing good that can be said about this McDonalds. I know not to expect much from McDs but I can't think of one positive about this place. The help makes you feel unwelcome. The food was horrible at best. And I just can't think of any reason I would ever want to go back here."}
{"text":"Horrible service went two different times and the people working there are rude unprofessional"}
{"text":"This small McDonald's is attached to a gas station.  I'm normally much of a fan of McDonald's but, this one impressed me.  I am ranking it compared to an average McDonald's.  This is pretty new, very clean, and also convenient.  As with others, it has free wi-fi.  They were moderately busy when I placed my order.  The server was very polite and friendly.  My food came quickly and had obviously been freshly made.  So, while I'm not generally a fan of McDonald's, in general, this one is better than average and i would stop there again if I needed a quick meal on the run."}
{"text":"As far as McDonald's goes, this is a good one.  Rarely do I have to wait and they haven't screwed up an order yet."}
{"text":"For 52 cents for a cone you can't go wrong. Perfect when were trying to kill a little time before having to drop my fianc√©'s daughter off."}
{"text":"This Mcdonalds is not only in the business of making crappy food and providing even crappier service watch out for the racket they have in the parking lot . If your not careful reading the sign at the the front of the entrance it is going to cost you $195.00 in parking fees. went in to to ask the management they just blew me off. lucky they are in vegas where they dont count on repeat businesssss."}
{"text":"I was walking down the Strip with relatives from out of town when they commented they were thirsty. At their behest we went into this McDonald's.\n\nThe line was long and ill-managed. Only one register was open despite the 30 or so people in line.\n\nMost of my companions got their soda right away. One person ordered a coffee, which took 20 minutes to receive."}

At the OJ and water.....pure re-hydrating goodness!!! The take ATM/Credit at the drive thru and are speedy and attentive when taking your order.\n\nOh BTW...the friend I was looking for...he was still in our hotel at the same craps table I left him at!!!!! I actually left the hotel cause I didn't think he would still be down there!! Gotta love Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Worst service in the world. Good store and location but really poor management skills from the manager to the other 300 training managers running around asking when can I get a promoted? The help is busy sticking stickers on each others butt's. You have to be kidding me....."}
{"text":"This is the most fucked up McDonald's you are gonna see.  Of course I didn't buy anything in here but really like going in there to use their bathroom because it's like negative McMoney for the big McCorporationBucks.com.  They have a shitty parking lot, people reading racing papers in the back, and a depressed Korean woman eating a chicken sandwich in the front.  There's a big old Golden Arches out there with lights all over it, like just regular light bulb lights.  The sign says \"new building coming soon\" and there are shitty renderings of a new fancy Dallas-style McD's with vegas lights all over it.  I can certainly wait for the new sign and building because I like the old one.  I went in here when I was buzzing on a Full Throttle slurpee which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"They had homeless people sleeping on the tables and wondering around like zombies bugging all of the customers. It's was really annoying  I will never go back to this location"}
{"text":"Just having come from a trip at the hotel across the street from this little wonder, I got to speak.\n\nNight one: About midnight I go in. There are about 5 people waiting in line. Fewer are behind the counter. The lights are on.\nMister Manager announces \"We close for 30 minutes! Order later!\". \nCurious. Rude. Dismissive.\n\nNight two: The layout of the place makes for poor line control. From S. Las Vegas Blvd. won walks into a box type eating area, then for no good reason the ordering counters swing to an angle. One is challenged as to were the line is, and which line they are in.\n\nThe management staff was rough with staff, and the staff seemingly part of the Clinton Welfare reform failure.\n\nPeople working in a McDy's on \"The Strip\" need a certain group of skills.\nThe one's at this McDy's, lacked skills."}
{"text":"John the manager at this mcdonalds was rude and did not want to provide customer service. In the middle of ordering drive through he refused to accept order. I guess he thinks because he has flashy lights he can do as he likes.  I do not recommend this Mcdonalds.  Take it for what its worth.  Hope you have a better experience than I did."}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's ever! If you're looking for customer service this is definitely not the place.  How hard is it to get an order right? Or, I don't know,  how hard is it to work the drive thru window and pretend to know what your doing!! Ugh"}
{"text":"remember when i said I never eat at mcdonald's?  I think I did.  I vaguely remember a fried chicken sandwich sometime around 4am.  i think i might have slept in it, which wouldn't have been too bad, since i think it was soggy anyway.  drunk, vegas, and vacation are my excuses and i'm sticking to em"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Sat at the window for almost 15mins. 6 cars in the parking lot. No one asked for our order. We left."}
{"text":"Bar none.. Worst McDonalds. If you frequent this location you are assured to be greeted by a rude, disinterested and barely literate individual who will deliver you an incomplete or incorrect order. \nI live in the area and have kept a tally on my visits.... 15 visits in 1 year, 4 of the orders were filled with out any problems. All of which were performed by the morning breakfast crew, which is FANTASTIC. A couple of the morning people have been there a long time and you can tell that they actually care about their jobs and want to be there. \nI am sure it cant be easy to staff a McDs.. but this location is terrible.  If only i didnt get my yearly cheese burger craving, i would never go to this location again."}
{"text":"Not much has changed since my last review. The drive through lady was really nice which was a nice change of events. However, I have one important question : how do you forget the cheese on the cheeseburger? It's not rocket science"}
{"text":"AVOID THIS MCDONALDS AT ALL COST. STARVE INSTEAD. I live in the area and only go to this place one a year, and every year it's astounding how much of citadel for chaos it is. I would say, at the very least, to get your order reread back to you but this doesn't matter at this location. Horrid"}
{"text":"The food and service are okay, but the on-screen menu is horrible and difficult to read.\n\nThe food quality is the same as any McDonald's, being a franchise of course. The customer traffic is chaotic as you can imagine at the busy Eaton Centre mall, but the staff dutifully handle orders quickly and accurately.\n\nThe menus are displayed on large TV screens above and behind the cashiers. This is a common arrangement in many fast food places, but this particular McDonald's manages to do it VERY WRONG. The menu for the burgers has tiny text for the names and prices. If you didn't know McDonald's menu by heart before visiting, you are going to have a hard time.\n\nThe TV menu for the sides (fries, etc.), desserts, and miscellaneous is the absolute worst. The text is still small, and now it alternates between two information screens every 5 to 10 seconds. Which means you can't just stare at it to try to find the item you want; you have to wait and waste time when the menu changes. To make it worse, sometimes they just hide the menu and show large video ads on the screen, wasting even more time. This is the most horrible TV menu I have ever seen.\n\nSo again - food and service are fine, but the menu is bloody unreadable.\n\n(To clarify, in case the Yelp entry is not clear: I'm writing about the McDonald's location inside Eaton Centre, underground at the lowest floor, inside the food court.)"}
{"text":"It's cheap, its quick and its in the Eaton centre. The lineup system is a bit chaotic, but they usually have a lot of staff on.  One of the few breakfast options in the food court besides the Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"The most  dis-organized and chaotic McDonald ever!!!  Food sitting at the counter while you standing around waiting! There is no clear line up for ordering and waiting for your food. \n\nNot to mention, getting my order mixup! \n\nThe place need management and training for its staffs."}
{"text":"Really clean. Nice staff. Well run and organized order counter. Nicest McDonalds we've been in."}
{"text":"Food: This could be because they recently opened but the food tastes pretty top notch, not made sloppily. I feel happy munching on it =)\n\nAtmosphere & Service: Staff are nice and quick service, however on several occasions there were minor mistakes made when people were waiting for their order but they still delivered. The restaurant is kept clean and tidy, well stocked, it is very shiny in there. There is a separate cash area for McCafe as well. \n\nSomething to note, the non-handicap washrooms are on the second floor only.\n\nPricing: Same as any other McDonald's...."}
{"text":"I wasn't paying close attention to where on Young.st but going by the reviews, this is the place.\n\nWhen I first walked in I was pleasantly surprised by a large spacious area and caf√© section to place my order in.\n\nI noticed the stairs after ordering my artificial food and decided to enjoy the window seat which offered a lovely view of an old guy making out with a fat chic, a rustic wooden ceiling or out of the window a view of the Zanzibar. \n\nThat being said I would gladly poison my self at this fine establishment again."}
{"text":"Along with all the cool new restaurants in the Urban Eatery there's some old standbys like McDonald's. This is the only restaurant in the urban eatery that has it's own seating. the design follows with the new McCafe design that all stores are being transformed into. A little different though with this location is that there is a separate side of the counter for the McCafe. You can line up here to get your fancy coffee drink and a baked good instead of having to go through the line of people ordering the standard fare."}
{"text":"This  magical space ship McDonald's is out of this world.  Clean and magical it's a must visit for any fast food lover. With soda fountains up and down stairs it might even rival the flagship location. At least it's as close add you'll get in a non corporate location.\n\nWhile it doesn't have a McMuseum, it does have historic dates in McHistory on the walls, including a breakdown of the famous Big Mac in the closest thing you'll ever see to a hamburger blueprint.\n\nFunfact: Happy Meals?  Invented in 1979."}
{"text":"I HATE THIS PLACE.\nTrust me when I say, I never ever eat mcdonalds. Ever. Today was an exception.... I was starving and thought about the quickest and cheapest place in the food court, which unfortunately turned out to be mcdonalds.\nI entered what appeared to be world war 3... people scattered, children on the floor, bodies everywhere (not dead, but still bodies). I lined up and my cashier was possibly the rudest person I've ever encountered in a fast food place. If you hate your job that much, why don't you shut the fuck up and not work?\nThe cashier's name was YuJuan so if you ever encounter this unfortunate excuse for a human, please run as fast as you can without looking back.\nI ordered a mcchicken meal and I knew I would have to substitute my drink through her. (for an iced coffee instead of a coke I can pour for myself from the fountain) Before I could ask her though, she held out her hand rudely and declared I had to pay.... well no fucking shit I have to pay. She didn't even tell me the price (and I wouldn't know) so I had to look at the screen myself. So, I paid this woman and told her after that I would like an iced coffee instead, and she got very angry and claimed I have to tell her before I paid. Um.... I tried, did I not?\nShe lectured me for a whole minute with a dirty look that she had to put it in the register for a substitution. Well then. Do it, don't tell me. \n\nAnyways. Last time coming here, peace out mcdonalds from hell."}
{"text":"So I came here about 15 minutes ago and literally was in line for a good 5 min due to there being 3 cars in front once it's my turn I wait about 30 seconds and I have a lady take my order who by the looks of it couldn't here. She was very direct and so was I. Usually I hear the how are you doing what can I get for you tonight but I get its quite busy. So I said my order and had to repeat myself a couple times. She gave me my total and proceeded to the second window. By the time I turned the corner the first two cars were gone there was only this annoying black Chrysler whom the whole time was going slow and they didn't have a big order as I saw earlier on the screen before pulling up to give mine so I have no idea why it took them so long to give them their order. Finally after waiting for what felt forever there was a guy and an older lady whom I assume was the one who couldn't punch in a simple order. Anyway the guy took my card didn't ask for ID as I was reading when I pulled up. Like if you are going to have a sign go through with it and be consistent. Not that I think a person would really steal a card and go straight to McDonald's but I digress. He gave me my two bags and two cones literally without a word or eye contact like cmon are you that upset at your lousy yet easy job. It wouldn't kill you to say have a good night thank you. I said thank you and guess what no response. Poorest customer service I've ever seen and it's at night like around 11:15 how could you possibly be so busy you can't say thank you. This location is closer than the one on Boulder highway when you need a bad late night snack but never again this place has not one good decent employee during this visit. Who ever that guy was on duty tonight needs to get some customer service training and the lady needs new ears or a new headset."}
{"text":"I hate this place. The people here are so rude, the staff are annoying to have to deal with."}
{"text":"Not bad service even during late nights. I usually go here when everything else is closed and I'm hungry. \n\nAnyways, everything else is like any other McDonald's."}
{"text":"Nice, clean remodel McDonalds. Employees were very friendly and food was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"omg this has to be the worst mcdonalds ever they dont take credit cards the food is allways cold, undercooked, or just made haphazardly, they are allways out of just about every thing the chicken is allways rubbery or jus coated in way too much mayo. go to the mcdonalds on park street first or burger king or Wendy's. or lick a buss window  it would be better."}
{"text":"Evrytime I go through this location i always get employees with attitude, it isnt our fault youre upset for whatever reason you should not take it out on your paying customers"}
{"text":"The only reason this location is getting a one star review is because I can't give them a zero star review. I was frustrated because they did not have a after hours menu visible to the public on the drive-thru reader, and kept telling me I could not get what I was trying to order. At this time I explained that I was frustrated, and the employee told me that if I was going to use profound language, which I did not, \"then you can just leave!\", this is no way good  customer service, I am an assistant manager at another fast food chain and would never let any of my employees talk to a customer that way, the goal is to always create a good experience for the customer and to allow them to come back or to encourage them to come back, I will never stop at this location again because I was not giving good customer service.  Employee at the drive-through window was also not wearing an ID badge or a name tag telling me who they are, but she's in pink glasses and a long blonde brown ponytail."}
{"text":"Went there at 12:30 a.m. I was told that there was a wait on fries, which I didn't mind. When I got my food the chicken nuggets were old and the large fries were the equivalent to a medium."}
{"text":"Not to complain much but my Big Mac bottom bun was hard as a rock. I asked for a new bun and the manager handled it perfect but after I asked for a new bun the cook responded with why doesn't he come back here and make his own food and had a stare down like it was a major issue. Just thought you all would like to know this garbage also the person I brought has to wait over 20 min for cold food.. Great"}
{"text":"We went through the the drive thru, and they couldn't figure out our order despite repeating it SEVERAL times at the window. Finally they assured us they got it right. We should NOT have trusted them! A burnt bagel and no chocolate milk. Thanks for messing up our morning and crushing our dreams!"}
{"text":"Hope I can give no stars. Waited  13 minutes before in got to the second window. Then waited more. Already now over fifteen minutes. I don't go for fast food often, but man, this isn't fast. I now had to leave for an appointment with no food. Silly me for thinking there was time. \n\nAvoid this location if at all possible."}
{"text":"It got remodeled so it looks nice. Too bad I can't say the same about the drive thru staff. I swear, they are always in such a rush that they screw up your order 70% of the time. It's annoying to repeat your order three times and they still screw it up. Can you guys slow the heck down enough to actually listen and pay attention please?"}
{"text":"Update: the remodel makes this fast food place a much hipper experience. The play area is the same but theres a different seating setup. They also have tvs now. 4 stars."}
{"text":"I love how they redecorated this McDonalds. Looks so modern. N I like how it's like more like a lounge now with the comfy chairs n flat screen tvs. Definitely a lot cooler than most fast food restaurants"}
{"text":"Just came here they told me only taking cash then to wait - 10 minutes later i said hello are you ready- they repeated the same thing and said to pull up to the next window i said what kind of mcflurries do you have they said none our machines are down."}
{"text":"Just went to their drive thru to get my son a happy email and my wife a Coke. It was an easy order, a happy meal with an additional large Coke. When I got home and opened the happy meal there was no fries....no fries. I called and asked to speak with the manager. He was barely audible and when I told him what happened there was total silence on the other end of the phone. I had to retell my story three times. There was no apology, however, he asked me if I wanted to come back and get my fries. I told him no. Terrible customer service. I guess when I go to McDonalds I not only have to pay for the food, but also provide quality assurance to make sure I get my full order."}
{"text":"Very modern design. Play area is great for older kids, very dirty though. Bathroom was filthy...urine on each toilet and the floor. No toilet paper. It was very crowded at 4pm.  Service was good and food fresh."}
{"text":"This location was remodeled, the most significant change is the drive thru (at least for me, since I only order through drive thru now). It now has two lanes, which from my experience, surprisingly has quick service. Besides that, nothing significantly different from other Mickey D's."}
{"text":"It's a McDonalds, so I'm sure everyone knows what to expect here. They try to get you through as fast as they can with not much in the way of smiles or true customer service. I wish my kids didn't love Happy Meals so much, then I'd probably never eat here. But since they do, I'll snack on a Grilled Chicken Sandwich or just grab a Caramel Frappe. I have to say, this location seems to be consistently fast. The lines can really wrap around the building here, but I've never had to wait long at all. I like that, so three stars it is!"}
{"text":"I had a bad experice with this place not wanting to make me breakfast at 1 pm, but since I've been back they are pretty good. The drive through lady is very friendly usually, that goes a long way with me."}
{"text":"This place offers the nicest Play Place I've ever seen!  And the rest of it is clean, modern and cool, offering a welcome respite from the Summer heat - a worthy place to take the kids - even older tweens will enjoy it here.\n\nI can't speak much of the food because the only thing we ever order here is a drink or a cone.    Minus 1 star for not offering more vegetarian fare."}
{"text":"Two stars: The place was disgusting or had ever gotten ill from it then I would give it one star. My problem is with the atrocious level of service. Granted, this is McDonald's but I would think that the franchisee with a reputation to maintain would make sure that its employees made some sort of effort.\n\nThe staff of mostly teenagers definitely do not deserve $15 an hour.if they're trying their best then this is a bad indicator of where America's newest generation of adults is headed. First, how about not make me wait 30 seconds drive-through speaker. And then when I finish ordering after I say thank you, 'Yup' is not the correct answer. It might be nice if the fries were consistently salted too. I didn't realize that I had to ask for things like straws and napkins. And to McDonald's Corp. or the franchising directly: don't charge me for extra McNugget sauces -- it's not like you're holding gold in those little square packages."}
{"text":"Yay oh Yay oh Yay!!!\n\nI usually don't go to fast food restaurants; okay,,, I rarely go eat at a fast food joint.  However, with the breaking news that the McRib is back!!!  I had to go.  I have no idea why they only sell this once a year for only like 5-6 weeks!  Why oh why!???\n\nMy wife thought I was crazy, but I went and bought 8 of these puppies last night.... gave her one, I devoured two, and stuck the other 5 in the fridge for tomorrow's delight.\n\nI guess I am one sick person...

{"text":"Several pet peeves here that dropped this down from an almost 4 star rating, to a solid 2 star. The biggest peeve BY FAR is charging 50 cents on a dollar McDouble for extra onions. That's right, those dehydrated/reconstituted things they pass as onion? 50 cents. You can buy a whole sandwich for 99 cents, but ask for a bigger handful onion and it's another 50 cents! Same thing for Mac sauce. Yesterday's Big Mac was juicy and tasteful, today it's dry and brittle. Ask for extra Mac Sauce and it's 50 cents.\n\nBy the time you leave the drive through you could easily pay $2 dollars or more in upsells. From onion, to Mac sauce, to pickles... this location is upsell after upsell after upsell. If the extras are so valuable, why don't I get a markdown when I order a McDouble with NO ONION for my dog?\n\n2 months ago I went in and ordered some oatmeal cookies. The display case clearly had enough to fill my order but 5 minutes later I reasoned that they were baking up some fresh (which they have done from time to time when they are sold out). 10 minutes later I ask what's going on and the cashier says \"Oh, here they are\" and proceeds to pull them old ones from the display case. In those 10 minutes they could have made fresh and with that kind of delay, it's what I expected. I refused the old cookies and asked for fresh. The black manager girl refused and said to take the old ones and that's it. When I refused, she began to issue a refund. I walked out without my money and without the cookies. It simply wasn't worth it. Ghetto attitude, ghetto people will deliver ghetto service."}
{"text":"I come to this locations out of convenience because its closest to me. Everytime is the same thing. They take long to take your order at the drive thru or to even greet you. When taking the order sometimes its hard to hear them and they get their attitude when asked to repeat the question. Most of the time the cashier isn't even where he or she needs to be! (Completing transactions) I have to wait until their finished goofing off so they can come to the register . And also they take long giving the food. Overall worst service! Who ever is managing this Location need to get fired and they need a new staff."}
{"text":"Didn't realize I already left a horrible review! One horrible review deserves another, I suppose! Waiting in the longest drive thru line and finally get to the window to pay. The girl is still pretty occupied trying to get other people's orders in, so I wait. She runs my order through me and I tell her I wanted a large fry instead of the medium she put. She corrected it and gave me my new total. While she's doing this, I can hear people yelling at her about the way she put an order in. She explains back that that was the only way she knew how to put it in. Seems like once they knew the order, they should've left it at that instead of still berating her for it. The wait to the second window was even longer. Seems like the hold up was that they didn't have enough people working. I finally am getting my food and I tell my son to check it. The medium fries I had changed to large were still medium, despite the changes being made. I point it out to FLOWER and she gives me attitude right off the bat. She tells me that is not what I ordered and that I was charged for a medium. I showed her my receipt and apparently ordering a medium Sprite means I get a medium fry...??? I told her I've been waiting in this long line for over 10 f***ing minutes and she tells me not to cuss at her and in front of my son. I was emphasizing how long my wait was but she obviously wanted to make it a bigger issue and threatened to call the cops on me. Then she takes my fries and refuses to give them back. I told her I didn't want the large if according to her I didn't pay for it and all she was going to do was spit in them. Cussing back and forth between me and FLOWER ensued. She did not appear to care about her cussing in front of my kid, guess it's just when I do it for emphasis. She, obviously, cannot handle the pressure of a busy establishment. I suppose working grave yard at a McDonald's is a step up from the call center she must've been at."}
{"text":"If you have an option to go to a different Mc Ds, do it, I have given this location several \"tries\". A few months back Mc Ds as a whole changed the amount of syrup they put in the iced coffees...ok, so I now ALWAYS order extra syrup which they charge me $.50 for at this location (most other coffee places don't do this) ok, charge me $.50 BUT if you do then you may actually want to give me what I've PAID for. I've made a habit when I go here to check, today I made the mistake not to because I was in a hurry & guess what, no extra syrup. This has happened more times than not. I will go out of my way to get my iced coffee w/ extra syrup at another location where they only charge $.30 & they get my order right more often than not."}
{"text":"Just thought I'd share but you guys absolutely lost my business after the consecutive \"Order mix ups\". I used to come by here for my coffee in the mornings and breakfast but due to the almost daily order issues I will now say that I have found my new coffee breakfast stop and it's sure not here. LETS GET IT TOGETHER!"}
{"text":"This McDonald's has the best customer service. I am always impressed with the friendliness of the staff. Usually I use the drive through but today I went inside. When the manager realized I was waiting in line, she asked another employee to hop on another register to help me. \n\nRarely will you find this kind of staff in a fast food environment. I wish more retail businesses operated and treated their customers as well as this McDonald's."}
{"text":"Thanks McDonalds on Stephanie, for your lack of support, in your community, you should take a few notes from the Green Valley McDonald's!"}
{"text":"OMG IM SO MAD. They ran out strawberry smoothies and gave me a strawberry shake instead but it was too sweet and nasty!!! Would not recommend! And my bf was mad too they ran out of mcribs!"}
{"text":"My fave McDonald's location to date. Two drive thru lanes outside. It's next to Target & Ross, which could be one's next spot after eating. The inside is always clean and there are lounge areas along the interior of the place. It's like a Cafe lounge place. I love eating the Sundae cone dipped in chocolate and I come here for that and I lounge and relax & people watch. I have not seen any homeless folks come to panhandle, which is great & the service is fast. They are open 24 hours so anytime I cannot sleep I come and chill here either drinking sweet tea or eating the dipped Sundae cone. They also have flat screen televisions so the patrons can watch television should they choose to."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy coming to this location. It's remodeled nicely and I like dining in on the rare occasion that I decide to go to McDonalds. I was very disappointed with their drive through staff. While I did want a quick breakfast, I would have preferred that they slowed down at least a tad bit to actually hear my order and fill it correctly. I felt rushed and like the staff really didn't care to help me out. When I ordered my breakfast sandwich I clearly said I wanted sausage egg and cheese later to find out I only got sausage. I found it weird that they didn't hear me but when my boyfriend turned to me and asked if that was it they heard him thinking he said that that was all and told us our total and rushed us on to the pay window. NY boyfriend didn't even get a chance to order a drink and I would have held them up to keep our order going but I just didn't have the patience at the moment. \n\nI'd just suggest to the drive in staff to be more polite and take their time to make sure they are getting customers what they'd like. From what I've learned in the food industry communication is essential for customer satisfaction. That's something this location appears to need work on."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here, service is great, food is hot and fresh and the beverages they offer are excellent depending on what beverage you choose as long as it is in their menu.  There is always someone cleaning the dining and restroom areas which is always a good thing"}
{"text":"This McDonald's recently got remodeled and it looks SWANKY now! Very modern decor inside and a 2 lane drive thru outside! They have a lounge area when you first walk in with leather couches and a huge flat screen tv on the wall. I guess to hang out and drink coffee?\n\nThe seating area has a variety of tables and chairs all modern/retro looking which I liked. The service inside is fast as well as in the drive thru. The food is.....well it's McDonald's you know what's it like :D"}
{"text":"I wouldn't even bother to go to this location except it's the closest to my house.  Every time I go thru the drive thru, customer service is lacking and the order is ALWAYS WRONG!!! I always feel like the order takers are robotic and the dislike they have for doing their job comes out in their monotoned voices. Today, I asked if they still had a particular item and was told they did.  Come to find out at the payment window, they no longer carry the item (which disappointed my daughter). And every time I pull up to the 2nd window to get my order, I feel rushed by the rude person at the window. And when I open the bags to double check if the items are correct, I feel like they're rolling their eyes and wishing for me to just pull away. Although I'd check to see if all items are in the bags, the orders are still wrong.  They're either missing the right sauces, the correct toys (if they're going to just throw whatever in the happy meal or kids meal then just don't even bother to ask for boy or girl) and I'd ask for certain things not be put on my order such as tomato and what do I find when I get home..a stale looking tomato!! \n\nIf these people are soooo hating their jobs, then leave! I'm sure there are more appreciative people out there needing jobs that don't mind working at a fast food. They should take customer service lessons from the drive thru personnel at Taco Bell on Warm Springs and Stephanie. Every time I go there, they're always pleasant, cheerful and friendly."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to mc donalds for 1$ large drink always on-the-go it works ya know ! But the drive through staff is terrible ! They're rude they rush you to order... on their phone playing music ! Like this is your job not the kick it spot ! I feel uncomfortable after receiving my food like they could've tampered with it because they're all kids...definitely gonna find a new mc donalds...someone needs to get in there and fix these things .ASAP thanks."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is clean, has great customer service, and has a nice atmosphere. They are very welcoming to studying and families. \n\nIt is still just a McDonald's and I don't like that the PlayPlace has two entrances but overall this is a great McDonald's that meets all of its goals."}
{"text":"So after a disgusting exit from a tournament near the end of the night and in the middle of a pretty gross four day downswing, I decided if I was gonna hit rock bottom to do it the right way and drove my POS rental car into the drive thru lane at McD's! Haven't been here in over a decade, if not longer. \n\nThe menu looked absolutely unappetizing and I think I was legally insane at the precise moment I decided on the good ol' twenty McNuggets for $4.99 (Sadly, I saw the 40 piecer for $8.99 and quickly considered it, but that luckily only lasted a mere millisecond). Got only 19 nuggets in my 20pc order and no ketchup for my large fries which was only 75% full. I should probably give them an extra star for looking out for my health, but I'm too lazy right now to scroll the mouse up there :p\n\nSadly, I got the McNuggets with BBQ sauce since I'm still on the pre-millenium menu and assumed they only had that or ranch. Kind of sucked when I opened the box and saw the options, one of which was honey mustard. \n\nMcD's, I'll be back in another decade. Maybe."}
{"text":"This has got some of the laziest, most disrespectful employees I've ever encountered in my whole life. The drive thru employee was rushing us to order. Mind you it was late at night, so there were no other customers. The person on the intercom was so rude that I just couldn't order food from them, because I didn't trust them. I mean if that's how they treat customers over the intercom, how do they prepare the food? I wasn't about to eat food prepared by someone who can't even treat others with a tiny dash of respect. Fortunately, when we informed the manager Lisa, she was apologetic about it, and assured us that she'd take care of it. She asked us who the employee was, and told us that the employees knew she didn't tolerate stuff like that. She also offered us to come back and order, but by that time we had already ordered at Burger King."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would I got an iced coffee way too sweet and watered down way too to creamy just terrible and I went back to change it and I go the same things just sweeter I was on my way to work so I had no time to go back once again."}
{"text":"This McDonalds both looks classy, and the employees seem to be upbeat and good at their jobs. I've never had a poor experience here, and will continue to visit this location in the future."}

{"text":"Not the worst McDs in town. I often judge McDs on hygiene and this place was fine. Not the best but passable."}
{"text":"Tried the new Med. Signature Veggie McWrap here and it looks like I was missing a quarter of it... certainly didn't look like the pictures where you see it coming out of the top. Makes me want to quote Wendy's old slogan of \"Where's the beef\" except here it's the veggies. Really, you need to be so cheap on the vegetables? There's no meat.... pile it on, people. On mine, you have to do a picture from above to see anything inside which left me feeling duped! Even if you are doing take-out, you still have to fill your own soda. They were having the dollar-days for coke and was charged the regular price until I pointed it out."}
{"text":"Well, it's a McDonald's... Standard service, no bad experiences so far. The McDonald's experience expected from a McD."}
{"text":"Friendly service..but there is nothing more aggravating then getting home and not having any sauce for your chicken nuggets..i mean its real simple..you take order\nSomeone prepares the food. You place order in bag.."}
{"text":"I have been to this McDonald's location a few times.  For the most part the food is consistent, place is clean, and the service good.  Like any fast food joint, it gets crazy busy around lunch time.  I would recommend this location if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Very fast. Slightly disappointed. Wendys always gives my dog nuggets. The guy at the drive thru was confused."}
{"text":"Plenty of seating in the afternoon, seemingly clean tables and floors, quick and polite service, and prices as good as the next McDonald's. Unfortunately I'm giving this place three stars because it smells bad. Like, really bad. It's probably because there are homeless/crazy people sitting at every few tables after using the bathrooms and picking at leftover food. \n\nMy advice: get your order to go or eat on the patio (umbrellas for sun protection) and you'll be all good."}
{"text":"This is a great McDonalds location! Located on the Las Vegas Strip, I love it. \n\nThere's usually a big line, however they work very hard to make your ordering process fast and easy. Although it's very busy, the tables are clean, and there are always tables available. Also, the bathroom was very clean.\n\nI rarely give a 5 Star Review... However, I feel this location deserves it. Many business' raise prices, because they are in a tourist location. This McDonalds has a full menu, @ normal McDonald's Prices! \n\nI would definitely recommend this location to friends and family. When on the strip, I suggest having a meal here."}
{"text":"ok I probably never like mcdonalds...but this one was good.  Right in the middle of the strip and its cheap!!!  Perfect lunch after losing money at Harrahs.  It is the exact same as any other mcdonalds but maybe a little more expensive.  Come on its a mcdonalds with an escalator...\n\nIf you want something quick and cheap its hard to beat mdonalds...especially after losing your ass on the slots."}
{"text":"We went in last night at 23:35 for a meal as we had been to see Le Reve and on our way home as we are Locals who live just off the strip we decided to go and get something to eat, we always choose the Quarter Pounder meal and so go 2 as normal, we waited 5 minutes which was fine as they seemed to be busy, but then when we sat down to eat our food discovered that we was missing our fries, I went back to the counter where I told the manager about the missing food, so i then had to wait another 5 minutes for our fries, by this time our burgers was warm, the staff looked like they did not want to be there, I watched one guy come in to the back and start touching food and yet did not wash his hands, the floor was dirty the staff not friendly as we use McDonalds allot this is not a good way to keep your customers happy!"}
{"text":"Mc Donald's is McDonald's! This one was in the strip so it was fairly busy! I'm sure all of us knows the deal about mcds.. Quick easy and cheap and that's really about it."}
{"text":"I would not go back to this McDonalds if my life depended on it! \n\n-smelly tables and floors \n-slow service and with an attitude \n-cold friers (the only thing I ordered) \n-for some reason it's packed! \n\nMaybe this is Vegas? I would rather pay a few more dollars and get a decent meal."}

{"text":"Went in January 10th at 1pm.  Was recorded on two EMPLOYEE'S cell phones while they were sitting at the tables on on their \"10 minute break.\"  One of them didn't even stop making fun of my friend and I when I went over to her.  One employee stopped when she noticed I was looking and listening to them.  The other girl just kept going, trying to get her friend on FaceTime to \"look at her.  you're not lookin!  look look the one in the shorts!  look!\"  When I called her out she denied it but I quoted her til she just stared at me.  \n\nIt's the Las Vegas strip ok..  people are going to dress in a way that you might not agree with but we are all people just out here having fun.  My friend and I weren't even dressed that strangely to be honest.  My friend had shorts and boots on with a jacket..  nothing hanging out.  I was wearing a dress with boots and a jacket.  It's not like we were showing a lot of skin.  Even if we were, though, you're in your work uniform on the floor of the place you work and you shouldn't be acting like a judgemental b****.  Save that for after you clock out."}
{"text":"I've visited this McDonad's every time we've traveled to Las Vegas and I liked it because of the location and the consistency of the food.  The dining area was clean and it was cheaper than a casino buffet when all one needed is a quick meal."}
{"text":"A stand alone store on the strip just had to be a crazy mess right? Well it was not.  I went there on a weeknight around 9pm. The drive-thru line was short, but moved extremely fast. The inside was fairly packed so I don't know how fast things were moving inside. The only thing that bothered me was the construction on Las Vegas Blvd. If you need some quick food and dont want to park. This is one of the only drive thrus on the strip."}
{"text":"Lines are LONG here when Vegas is crowded but they do move through them pretty fast. Plan to get breakfast to go if they're packed and it will make your life much easier. They're friendly here but seem to manage to screw up orders to check that bag before you leave or you might get an unpleasant surprise. Nothing special but it's a decent and cheap breakfast location with okay iced coffee."}
{"text":"I give this mcds 4 starts because it gets busy and hectic during late night on the weekends. Although this is a factor, Marcus the manager does his very best to make sure everything goes smoothly. Marcus is a great manager and definitely keeps an eye on every aspect of this mcds making sure it goes smoothly and meets professional standards. A+ for Marcus at this location!!"}
{"text":"This McD is located next to Harrah's hotel and has an escalator going up but you gotta use the stairs going down. \n\nThey're always busy but workers are very efficient and my order was ready in no time. I appreciate people who do their job well."}
{"text":"The cashier was very rude when it came to ordering our food. I get that it'll get busy since it's a tourist area and people get hungry, plus it is a fast food, can't expect much, but do not get rude with us. Everyone else is friendly besides her!"}
{"text":"Up the escalator to McDonald's! For the strip the prices were good! Same menu. 2 for $5 Big Macs. Free water cups if you ask. Not too crowded. 2nd floor mcd was pretty cool! Food was good! Clean too!"}
{"text":"Great location, though a very small place given the foot traffic. Not much seating inside or outside. \nVery long line ups and limited menu choice.\nStaff is very quick and efficient. \nThe washroom needs repair though."}
{"text":"Long story short. Forgot to give me 2 sandwiches but proceeded to charge me for them. Even my 20 piece mcnuggets wasn't a full 20 piece. Granted you don't come to a McDonald's for service, this really pissed me off and I don't like being ripped off. Don't come to this store and try another branch if you're trying to grab some mcdiddy's."}
{"text":"The best mc Donald's I have been to in a long time! Marcus the manager had an uptight guest and handled it like a pro. His answer was he's only as amazing as his guests. Marcus you made my drunk experience that much more amazing! Marcus you are the definition of what it takes as a 3rd shift manger! You deserve a raise! I will be back because of you!"}
{"text":"Marcus has what it takes to be a manager. Polite and courteous . He is only as good as his guests are... Will come back again! Thank you ! Keep up the good work man. Takes guts to work on the strip! Coming from a fast food perspective!"}
{"text":"So I never go to mcdonalds and the one time I do...this happens. \n\nIf I could give this no stars, I would! \n\nBy far the worst place I have ever been to simply because of the one person that took my order, Older African American guy. As my mom and I stood there to order the cashier mistakes me telling my mom not to order the coffee from there and to get what she likes from Starbucks, as we were gonna go to Starbucks anyways, as me yelling at her. I was speaking in my language and maybe he mistook that as yelling but still gives him no right to react the way he did. \n\nSo right off the bat he threatens to call security on me, at which point my mom and I think he is joking. Then he asks my mom if she is ok. So mom is all confused and I'm trying to explain to him that I haven't even said anything. He gives us our total and I hand him my credit card. He makes a sly remark like \"good thing you are making up for yourself.\" \n\nAt this point I should have just said forget this order and go ahead and call security. \n\nI appreciate that he's looking out for elder abuse but he should think twice before threatening someone without knowing what they said. Definitely something corporate must hear about because this guy needs an attitude check."}

It is truly part of the community of Coraoplis, while it may be sad to some that this happens at a McDonald's, being a corporate beast, I'm just glad it stills happens, and where I can see it! It's something experience my whole life of McDonald's across the country and well-established locations and it warms my heart to see it again. Truly this is a American McDonald's. Thanks America! \n I got the mcdouble and a large iced coffee, it was fast, it was cheap, all the spots were hit. May the Gods Bless this McDonald's"}
{"text":"I usually wouldn't spend time writing about someplace like McDonalds, but I felt this one was warranted.  I realize that there aren't many options in the area, but maybe that is why the service can be as slow as it was.  It took almost 15 minutes from the time I ordered until I had my food.  I went through the drive through and had to repeat my order several times.  It was not complicated - it was a cheeseburger happy meal with a diet coke.  When I received my order, there was no cheeseburger in my box.  I'm glad I checked before I pulled away.  When I inquired about it, the person at the window said \"I don't know what happened, we put it in there\"    Then they \"found\" my cheeseburger and gave it to me.  \nOverall not a great experience.  I'll probably try to make sure that I eat prior to my arrival in Corapolis."}
{"text":"This is the best McDonalds anywhere, and that's saying a lot.  The place is clean and the staff are not rude.  The drive thru is pretty quick, but sometimes there is a bit of a wait.  They're pretty accurate with orders, and the food is edible as compared to other McDonalds stores.  If you're in Cori, and you need something quick, don't be scared of this place."}
{"text":"Hey its A McDonald's ...lol I have found the service to be average and you know your getting pink slime when you order, and your dam glad to get it too."}
{"text":"This is a very peculiar location. Sometimes I will get the best service here, and other times the service is so bad I don't come back for a while. Thankfully the service as of late has been pretty awesome.There soft drinks are absolutely amazing, and sometimes I go just for that. This location is the only fast food joint  in Coraopolis so we are pretty limited in our choices of close fast food."}

{"text":"I come here when my fiance who is pregnant craves french fries after having extreme food aversion to anything we try to eat at home. Usually it is pretty quick even though there are lines in the drive-thru as usual.\n\nI decided to Yelp this place today though because it is either extreme coincidence or racism that occurs each time I go. I honestly don't care either way, but I think it is interesting to report..\n\nI am a Caucasian adult male, and I commonly have African American adult males ringing me up or handing me the GIANT bag for the one order of french fries. Every single time so far they avoid looking at me, don't ask me if I need anything or any questions, and beyond that they literally do not say a WORD. Even when I say 'thank you' before I leave it is ignored.\n\nToday though, which is also why I wanted to write a review, FOR THE FIRST TIME, I was asked if I wanted ketchup, and my fiance didn't want any, but I was glad that someone thought about how they never give you anything, not even salt, on the side, and wanted to make sure the order was okay. The funniest joke about this was that he was an older Caucasian adult male. He even responded when I said 'thank you'. That is what made the difference of treatment stand out to me. I always assume fast food workers won't say a word, but this particular experience painted a weird picture over the different visits.\n\nI wish I would have asked his name. I think people deserve credit for doing things like that, it is exhausting to have to keep that energy with every customer all day."}
{"text":"For a fast-food restaurant, I have to give this place a 5 star rating.  I saw all of the past reviews and understood the reason for the low ratings.  My family and I were at the Verizon Wireless across the other side of the large parking lot; after 3+ hours of waiting in there, and we were STARVING.  Right across from this location is a Chic-Fil-A that we love but their parking area was full and the drive-thru line was long.  We saw this huge sign on this McDonald's \"Grand Opening\" and there were no more than two cars parked in their parking.  I remember reading the reviews but I knew the kids were starving and we all needed to use the restrooms as well.  So we crossed our fingers.... \n\nI don't know what it was, maybe it's because they felt changed, upgraded, or new but the staff was amazing!  Every single person actually seemed happy to be there.  They greeted us, took our order and we were handed over a pager.  (Guess it's better than yelling your name)  The restrooms were locked so when I asked for the \"key\" they pushed a button from the side wall and was advised it was unlocked and I could go ahead.  The ladies restroom was small but very clean.  Unfortunately, no paper towels to dry my hands with and so I had to grab the handle to open the door.  \n\nThe entire place was clean.  The soda fountain/ketchup area was very clean and in order.  Not a single dirty table or food anywhere on the floor.  The place is divided in half... the area with more tables and open seats (quiet area) and then the play area with more space between tables for parents/families.  They had comfortable chairs for the wheelchair accessible tables too.   \n\nIf you've been here before... give it another chance.  Yes, it's just fast-food.  There WILL be children but if you dine-in, there's plenty of comfortable seats away from the playground area.  We noticed that they had a lot of young children BY-THEMSELVES with no parents and no supervision around.  There was also a few homeless guests that stopped in but they were taken care of the same and they weren't bothering anyone.  I have nothing negative to say about this McDonald's.  We were hungry and our food looked and tasted good.  No soggy fries or over fried nuggets that have been sitting in old cooking oil - none of that.  \n\nAs I was taking pictures to share on Yelp... (I was spotted with my phone - lol)  a manager came up to me concerned, asking me if something was wrong.  I advised him that everything was fine.  He was actively involved assisting in the drive-thru as he was with the front registers."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and always make sure ur order is right. The food is done very fast and it taste great."}
{"text":"It's McDonald's so you know the menu and prices but do you know the location. This location is updated and clean. Fast friendly service both in the restaurant and at the drive thru. It is a busier location due to being centrally located but that does not stop this location from getting the job done."}
{"text":"Slow. Wrong order and didn't ask if i wanted cream and sugar. Saw one guy walking around aimlessly looking at the register. Wont be coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food restaurant for my French fries needs! Quick and great customer service. They are in a busy intersection so it is usually a busy drive-thru, but the wait is never long. Food wise it's what one expects of a typical McDonald's."}
{"text":"Wow what a change I thought. Wow it's so clean and fresh I thought. Wow the people are so friendly and helpful I thought. This remodeled Mcds is the bomb I thought. Up until halfway through my meal and the Mgr announces we all must leave IMMEDIATELY. No explanation, no REFUNDS, no NOTHING. Just that the owner said. So apparently it's still a cluster here and absolutely nothing has changed. Great Customer service people, STELLAR!!!! I will be emailing and calling until I get MY REFUND!!!"}
{"text":"Ok where to begin, first of all I know McDonalds isnt the greatest to begin with and that is fine its not the food that is terrible here it is the entirely operation. This franchise is probably the worst thing in the entire world they have no consistent hours of operations. They advertise as 24 hours but sometimes they are open and others not at all. Just drive a little bit further to a different location or go to jack n box and save yourself the headache."}
{"text":"The Mexicans here are very rude and will never get your order right.  I would ignore this place due to its lack of communication and poor customer service.  Good luck trying to get 15$ an hr for what you do.  Thumbs down!"}
{"text":"flies everywhere, place is dirty and food not cooked well."}
{"text":"I waited 45 minutes in the drive through line with 3 cars in front of me. The cashier did not even apologize for the wait. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm not gonna lie.  I feel a bit silly reviewing a McDonalds, but you have to give credit where it's due.  The five stars goes to the morning crew.  There have been many mornings where i have been hungry on the way to work, so i succumb to the temptation of the golden arches.\nI used to be intimidated if there are four or five cars in line.  Not at this place.  And not only are they SUPER fast, it's ALWAYS fresh and delicious.  I'll often pick up egg and cheese mcmuffins for some of my coworkers and we all agree.  They must have magic elves in the kitchen because these are the best mcmuffins e.v.e.r.  \nI also think they must have some sort of mind control device that causes your time to speed up while their time slows down, because on more than one occasion, I've barely had to stop my car because there they are, window open, beverage and bag in hand, smile and \"have a nice day\" on their lips.  \nThe pm crew leaves a bit to to be desired, but the morning crew has me at hello."}
{"text":"They got my order wrong. Badly. \n\nOk, so on an afternoon that was pouring rain I made the decision to stop in for a bite to eat at this McDonald's. I ordered a McChicken and fries, plus a double cheeseburger and a drink. My sandwiches were both wrong, the fries were lukewarm, and the lobby looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a year. \n\nWhile the service was decent, the place was so busy inside that it took them forever to fix my order. Additionally, the place had been renovated recently so it was even more of an indictment that they were letting it look so bad. I just don't get it. Why not get better and build a better reputation post-renovation?\n\nIn the end, for me at least, this was a let down experience. On top of that, I had to get soaked on the way to my car because I stepped in a puddle. \n\nNice."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant negative stars I would! Mcdonalds service has gone so down hill and managers don't care. Never going back."}
{"text":"I guess I shouldn't expect much from McDonald's. I just wanted a quick coffee and some hashbrowns for my kids, it ended up taking at least 10 minutes. It wasn't even busy. I asked for ketchup, did I get any? No. Just a frustrating experience to have early in the morning."}
{"text":"This McDonalds is terrible \nThey want to nickel and dime u for everything now they are even trying to charge for expresso in  their Ice Mochas which should come with a set amount as they always did \nManagement sucks they always screw up at this location \nWe will not return which is unfortunate because its right around the corner from where we work and are regular customers"}
{"text":"I have been there 4 times this month and I repeated my order twice and they still messed up. When I was inside to place an order, they just looked at me and started talking to their friends. I almost turned around and walked out. The customer behind me was getting the same treatment. Thank you for your time."}
{"text":"I'm a social worker who visits homes in central Phoenix and this is my go to McDonald's when I need a cheap coffee or if I need to use the bathroom. This is the cleanest/safest McDonald's in the area and I never hesitate to stay here to do work if I'm feeling too cheap to hit up Starbucks. I've encountered the occasional weirdo, but I don't feel too bad when a non-weirdo is sitting on the other side of me. There are also TVs that usually play CNN or FOX (not sure). It's nice to hear the news while I'm sitting inside doing case notes! Highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Now this is one fancy treat! I went to this mcdonalds late saturday night and almost blew out my britches from the terrible burger king the night before when I realized how good the golden arche's prices treat ya! With the cost of gas more than your neighbors flapjack its hard to imagine how they cram all that chicken in each nuggy and keep it only a dollar to add on to ANY combo meal. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"It is so unhealthy and gross! the chicken there isn't even real. YUCK!!!"}
{"text":"NEVER can get an order right. I could repeat in slow mode and they will still get something wrong. The funny thing is that employees for McDonald's want to make $15/hr....that's laughable"}
{"text":"Worst McD's in the world wide Franchise!!! I live down the road and they consistently serve old, soggy fries!  The workers consistently sound irritable and commonly get your order wrong.  I usually would not waste my time reviewing a McD's but after 10+ visits to this McD's I am thoroughly dissatisfied.  Do your self a favor and drive down the road to the next McD.  Especially if you want hot, fresh, crispy McDonald's Fries!"}
{"text":"Occasionally I just feel like going out for just basic breakfast, i come to this particular MacDonald's.  It's a place to have a big breakfast and watch some of the interesting people that you now are regulars among others. It's always clean and the service pretty quick. it's by no means and exciting venue!   is okay for what it is.  I am not a big breakfast eater so it serves the purpose when I am in that particular mood.\n\nWhen I am traveling I often go to a MacDonald's for breakfast.  I usually need to eat something and can count on pretty standard fare and a decent price.  If it's just before catching a plane in the morning, a Greek meal that I might prefer first thing in the morning might not set well at takeoff as a big breakfast.."}
{"text":"I've heard about this restaurant from some friends and I thought I would try it out. The fries were AMAZING! The burgers tasted fresh and delicious. Everyone should try this place out just once! Even though hard to find, places like this are worth it."}
{"text":"This is by far one best McDonalds I've ever been to!\n\nFrench Fries are always fresh & HOT, drive through is always fast, special orders are completed by the time I get to the final window, and the most important thing - my order is always correct when I get home or to the office.\n\nDrive through is open 24 hours for those late night cravings.\n\nThey even have a charging station for your electric vehicle and a large indoor playground for the kids."}
{"text":"If I haven't had my coffee yet. I'll roll through here and ask for a Large with 10 cream and 10 sugars (Don't judge). This location has always been super friendly, works well under pressure, never seems stressed. And most importantly puts all 10 cream and 10 sugars in. Trust that I know when they don't!  This location never fails on their consistency and so far they're the only ones I can say that for . Big ups to this location"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am not one to complain because I've worked in fast food before but this is ridiculous.. Hate this McDonalds. Staff is rude. And service is horrible. I went through the drive thru getting my Neice and nephew food after school and I paid the guy in cash and some change and was a dollar short so I have him my card and I got my food and got home then I got home checking my bank account to see that I got charged for the whole meal on my card and then my niece told me her sandwich wasn't there.. So I got angry not only double charged but didn't get the food. So I went back and told the manager RION (that's his name) what happened and I was friendly at first but after waiting 15 minutes for him to count the register money to see if they were over tells me they are only 8 dollars over and I could take that or nothing.. I told him I was charged 12 extra on my card after already paying in cash. And I asked for the guy who was helping me before to come up to clear the confusion and the fucking manager tells me that he's working and they would slow business down if they brought him up. First of all, the business already sucks!! If he's charging everyone double and not giving the right food. So if you must go to McDonald's then go to any other one but this.. Horrible horrible horrible people there."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff, order the McNuggets."}
{"text":"Just do yourself a favor and don't go here. Worst customer service, food is always wrong and nasty and they charge for sauces."}
{"text":"ordered 1 hamburger  , the person took my bun and used it like a sponge to wipe down the prep counter , when I told my cashier he said he only wiped down the onions from the wraping paper , like it is ok to use your bun as a cleaning tool ."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, with McDonald's you are taking a gamble.  Half the time you get fresh food, and the other half you get food that has been sitting under the heat lamp for 45 minutes.  Today I got fresh food! But the fries were the leftover scraps and a bit soggy."}
{"text":"This is the McDonald's located just inside the newly remodeled Wal-Mart on 59th ave. & Bell.  Review is for breakfast experiences only.  Service was prompt and polite, and I didn't have to explain over and over that I wanted no bacon, or have a cashier that could not figure out how to order an \"egg and cheese biscuit\".  Food came up fast, tasted the usual McDonald's way, and then I was off to fight the other Wal-Mart patrons (at least the lady in front of me extinguished her mini-cigar before going into Wal-mart)."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean but that is the nicest thing I can say about it.  The food was horrible both times I ate there in the past two weeks!  I talked to the manager after the first time who acted concerned but less than a week later the food was still horrible!!!!  Fries were cooked in old nasty grease( taste like everything but fries) and the burger was not done or hot!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"After making two breakfast stops at other locations and realizing I wouldn't be eating anytime soon, due to Sunday wait times, I decided to head to McDonald's. Yes, I said it, McDonald's!  McDonald's has always had a decent breakfast menu and now offers breakfast all day, yippee for me!\nI arrived and waited at the counter for more than 5 minutes for an employee to take my order, even though there were employees all over.  I ordered a sausage, egg and cheese on a biscuit and a hash brown, only to learn hash browns are not included on the all day menu items, although it was on the all day menu board behind the cashier.  So, I decided to go with 3 hotcakes.  \nFirst, the 'hotcakes' were cold.  And, I got the Mcgriddle sandwich not the biscuit. After correcting my order the breakfast sandwich was just okay. The biscuit tasted a little stale and because I think they were rushed in correcting my order the cheese was not melted.  So, this morning breakfast visit was very disappointing....maybe I'll try again another time."}
{"text":"I rarely write up fast food places, but this particular location is amazing, not for the food but for the engineering that went into siting this location.\n\nLocated immediately opposite South Park Mall, this two-story McDonald's is a complete operation including drive thru, delivery to your car in waiting parking spaces and even has a piano in the main ordering area.\n\nMy 96 year old dad's doctor is next door so we always get something while there for his monthly check-ups.  Dad LOVES the McDonald's burgers and is happy as a little kid when he gets his order.  Never fails...thanks McDonald's.\n\nIt is tricky to get in, so just trust the signs.  Coming off of always busy Fairview Road you come down a narrow drive and almost immediately make a left into the drive thru/enter entrance.  You circle the building and have to look quickly to find a parking space.  If you dally, you have to re-circle that narrow area.\n\nA masterful siting for the building and the inside reminds me of the giant McDonald's in Asia.  Multistory and all the goodies.  And it is immaculate.  Have never seen a scrap of misplaced paper.\n\nSame consistent food selections done exactly as they are in every other location."}
{"text":"Wow.  This McDonalds is hecka classy.  There's a baby grand piano, it's two stories, and everything is clean and immaculate.  There are numerous tables outside on the second floor balcony and the seating plan is perfectly laid out on the inside.  As far as facilities are concerned, this is the best McDonald's I've been to.\n\nThe food.... is the same as regular McDonald's which I think is AOK.  I don't know how some people are so picky with their $6 combo meals.  Besides waiter service, I don't know what else I would want!  I ordered my usual Big Mac Meal and it was delicious.  I got a great portion of fries, I had a great selection of drinks to choose from, and I had a wonderful environment to eat.  There's even a big TV with the news on so you can catch up on your current events."}
{"text":"I was just waiting in line prior to midnight, and there was a car in front of me, and we were both waiting in line, and as soon as I pulled up to the kiosk, still before 12am, i waited, I waited, and then they turned the lights off... they didn't say a word, they simply turned the lights off even though i had been waiting a solid 5 mins before closing. Normally this wouldn't bother me, but this particular location has gotten my order wrong on several occasions, and i let it go. Im sorry, if someone pulls in, waits, prior to your closing hour, you need to serve them. Do not wait until the 3 mins before your closing and turn off the lights because it is a Saturday night and you don't want to deal with anyone else. I've had jobs in fast food and been a server, and some times, them the brakes...deal with it. I am done with this location entirely. Thanks for reminding me of why i should not eat fast food."}
{"text":"Expectations are modest for service at a fast-food restaurant, but this location is a far cry below standard. The wait is always 10-15 minutes, even when they're not busy at off-peak times. I just pulled into drive-thru at 9:45 on a Friday, was the only car in line, and sat for almost eight minutes at the order kiosk without a response. By the time I left, there were seven cars backed up, and no one manning the fast food line. There's a Burger King around the corner; the food ain't great, but at least it's fast."}
{"text":"This is a McDonald's that makes me want to put my pinky up in the air when dunking chicken mcnuggets into various sauces.  First of all, it's a two story McDonald's!  WIN right across the street from Southpark Mall (in the middle of it all).  I always liked going upstairs and people watching from the upstairs patios.\n\nI've never had sub-par fast food here, so they are super consistent with the way they make stuff.  Wasn't a huge fan of the cashier my last visit.  He just kinda stood there and took my order without talking to me... could have been a long day, but it was a bit awkward.  When my food came out, he didn't call me over... so it was sitting there for a while until I noticed it.\n\nI'm liking the addition of the self playing baby grand in the bottom floor... really classes it up.  Pinkys up!"}
{"text":"Decent McDonalds. Definitely better than the one in Houston that I used to go to and wrote a complaint on them for being consistently negligent. I like this one and its a keeper! \n\nPlace - two stories and for the most part, clean.\n\nPrice - it's Mickey D's. \n\nService - somewhat quick in the drive-thru, friendly people. They only forgot once, but it's forgivable."}
{"text":"This is a five star McDonalds so to speak. There's a baby grand player piano and an upstairs with tv. However the service and food quality are standard run of the mill McDs. I'm writing this from the upstairs after buying my daughter a happy meal. Her fries are cold as are the nuggets. The sprite is all soda no syrup. I got a small choco shake which was barely mixed. I think it's actually vanilla. Not fatal errors but either they're short handed or they just don't take pride in their job. Hope this is just a fluke."}
{"text":"One of the nicest McDonald's I've been in, which of course is what you would expect for a neighborhood like this - Southpark. There is a piano in the lobby and there are two levels.\n\nThe crew here seem to have more of a clue than other McD's I've patronized, but the main problem with this one is that it is very difficult to get into and out of. It is a very narrow pad with the drive through and I have no doubt that there are any number of minor fender benders with the quality Charlotte drivers and the massive vehicles in this part of town.\n\nThere is a large TV upstairs and I did manage to find a couple of power outlets. Free wifi, as in all McDonald's.\n\nAll I can say is: be wary!"}
{"text":"I called this McDonald's location to ask if their salad was kosher.  As a kosher diet is a very important part of my religion. The employee who answered the phone was very rude and told me to, \"Go ask yo mama.\"  The employee hung up on me so I called back and the same employee kept saying, \"This is the police department, how may I help you.\"  She said this in a very threatening manner.  Clearly this location and its employees don't care about religious observances and cultural differences."}
{"text":"We went here today for breakfast and the service was great. Got back and told the Minick's family to go there."}
{"text":"The inside is what sets this McDonald's apart. No point talking about the food, y'all know what to expect. But what is unexpected is that there is a player piano in the front downstairs tinkling pleasant quasi-classical tunes. \n\nUp the circular staircase upstairs is wi-fi and cable news on a big screen at a tolerable level. People were set up with their laptops and the overall effect was really manageable. I rarely ever want to go IN to a fast-food place because the environment is usually such a turn-off, but this location is a nice alternative. Unlike a previous reviewer, I found the place to be quite clean and this was at a very busy lunch time. \n\nGetting in is a bit of a trial as you have to cross through the drive-through line and the people in their cars are not really looking out for pedestrians.\n\nI'd return here for a place to linger a bit, which is a shocker when I think about it."}
{"text":"Holy cow - for a location like this to be this bad... It's right across the street from South park Mall for crying out loud - South park mall has done everything it can to make itself \"upscale\" and this travesty is across the dang street! Some of the staff barely speak English and will mess your order up if you don't get standard menu items. Luckily for me I stopped eating trash (which is what you get at any fast food joint) so I don't eat here anyway. But, 50 pounds heavier ago I did. I even contacted the manager once to complain about my repeated horrible experience. She said she would send me some coupons and acted like I was wasting her time. I never received anything and also never ate at this location again. I can't stand bad customer service. That's what you get at this location (along with the \"poison\" this place peddles). This location is to be avoided - the burger king just across the street has better staff and if you are going to eat junk food - it would be a better choice."}
{"text":"I was super wary about this stop because of previous reviews, but they have apparently stepped their game up... \n\nThey have a new (or at least new to me) 60 second or less service guarantee and I was definitely wondering if the \"quality\" of the food would suffer since they were trying to move so quickly... I was very pleasantly surprised... Not only were we through the drive thru in about 60 seconds, my food was incredibly hot and fresh... Well, you know, as fresh as McDonald's is... \n\nIt was a quick trip with hot food which is what I wanted, so I was pleased..."}
{"text":"This McDonald's has a confusing as hell Drive Thru route. You have to circle the entire building to get to the Drive-Thru section. I was so hungry for my fatty indulgence that I pictured myself accidentally running over a patron as I high-tailed my way around the corner to get to the drive-thru lane. Yeah, this location looks all fancy-shmancy but they really, really disappointed me.\n\nI got a nugget meal to-go, only to go home and find that they forgot the SAUCE! Nuggies with no sauce? I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy! I looked at my receipt and it was right there-- \"S&S sauce $0\". But, there was no sauce. I tore through my bag, hoping that it was hiding under the fries, but there was no sauce to be found.  I could have broken down in tears right then.\n\nFor that, I will not return to you. You have forsaken me."}
{"text":"I used to like this Mcdonald's location. But recently getting really disgusting. A lot of flies are flying around. Their floor is sticky. Tables and chairs are always nasty. It's really turned me off. I didn't get anything there!"}
{"text":"I have been sitting in the drive through now for 15 mins, still 3 cars back. They are hire incompetent morons. Can't wait till robots take over their jobs."}
{"text":"I can count on one hand how many times I go to a fast food restaurant within a year and you can almost bet it equals late night and alcohol. Last night was no different.  MickeyD's was calling my name.  I stopped at the one on Fairview Road.  Service was fast and pleasant.  My french fries were so hot I couldn't eat them right away.  Le Big Mac was the perfect amount of gooeyness from the special sauce and I don't know what their secret is for fountain drinks, but the Coke at McDonald's always taste better than anywhere else. Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally review a McDonald's on this site because...well, it's McDonald's.  If you're not familiar with them, are you from another planet?  This particular one across from SouthPark Mall deserves its own entry, though, because of its uniqueness.  Due to SouthPark codes, they had to make McDonald's blend in, and they did a nice job.  The two-story brick building is actually quite attractive and \"fits\" in with the upscale SouthPark \"theme.\"  \n\nIt's conveniently located across from the mall...and in front of Original Pancake House.  I had the pleasure of dining at this McDonald's when OPH had an hour wait.  We wanted to eat breakfast and get on the road to do some shopping and that long delay wasn't fitting into our schedule.  Cut to:  us walking from OPH to McDonald's, not more than a few feet away.   We ordered breakfast and sat upstairs on the second level.  Breakfast was good, as it usually is there, and it was fun looking out the window at the SouthPark area.  How often do YOU get to look down on SouthPark people like they look down on you?  Ha!"}
{"text":"RUDE RUDE RUDE. I normally NEVER leave a review of a fast food chain, but this is an exception.  The workers are just plain rude.  The fries were nasty and the bun on my burger was stale.  Avoid this place unless you just don't give a crap about how your treated and want a sub par Big Mac."}
{"text":"I roll through this drive thur an embarrassing number of times per week. Overall this McDonald's is one of the better ones. The fries are for the most part always hot. But this is my only complaint... The sweet tea has been off lately. The person saying they've been using tap water could be on to something."}
{"text":"This place is truly hit and miss... The breakfast is best here like many other reviews say here the drive thru is rediculously laid out while I've never encountered rude staff here I gotta say it's only selling point is the location,being 2 stories, and the piano is awesome but it is mcdonalds keep in mind so the food can only be so good even if it's hot and \"fresh\" \n\nEat here at your own risk and since they close at midnight this isn't a drunk food spot"}
{"text":"McDonald's is McDonald's there's  nothing really special to say. Quick cheap food with a tolerable customer service. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Nasty!  The food and the staff.  The people here do not have a care in the world and only want the day to end so they can get paid.  The food is absolutely horrible and yet so many people with limited taste buds frequent this place.  \nThe only place worst is Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"By McDonald's standards, this location is downright luxurious! \n\nThe service is great some shifts, and shifty other shifts, but the setting makes up for it.\n\n In addition to the baby grand piano in the corner of the first floor-- there's a fireplace and large TV on the second floor, and a balcony for outside seating.  There are even framed paintings on the walls!  (Well, they're to the caliber of those art show liquidation paintings that cost $5, but I appreciate the ambiance enhancer.) \n\nEspecially fitting since this MickyD's is across the street from Nordstrom!"}
{"text":"It's a McDonald, you can't expect an amazing experience. \nThis McDonald is in an excellent location, right across the street from Nordstrom and Belk's in South Park Mall. Two stories with a huuge playground attached for kids. This is children's haven. The upstair even has a piano, tell me a McDonald that has this? \nPlenty of seating, the store itself is clean enough, a lot of sunlight and open ceilings since it has 2 floors. Service is not superb but not terrible. Overall, if you compare this McDonald with other McDonalds around the area, or even around the state, you will find that this one is quite superb."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is terrible. From the service, to the quality of the food, it's crap.\n\nLet's ignore the silliness of reviewing a McDonald's and let me share my perspective. I like good food, I like cooking and going to nice restaurants and all that jazz. But let's face it, some days you just want a shitty cheeseburger for $2 and you need it quickly before you stop yourself from doing something stupid. \n\nThis McDonald's is fairly slow. I've been there many times and I usually have to wait around 10 minutes for food, whether it's the middle of lunch rush or a dead afternoon. \n\nThe food is very sub par. I consistently get stale food that has clearly been cooked hours ago. Whether it's a burger, chicken nuggets, etc. Even the soft drinks. Yes, the soft drinks. They draw the drinks in advance, and then they sit on the counter for what I would guess is at least 20 minutes. I started noticing my drink was really flat, and then I realized what they were doing after going back and seeing a mountain of medium cokes just sitting beside the machine. I know how these places work, and getting food that isn't hot and made to order is expected, but this is CONSISTENTLY not fresh, no matter what time of day. And the pre-drawn drinks is just a whole new level of garbage that no one should have to tolerate. How much effort does it take to get a fresh drink for your customers?\n\nThe staff is also not great as a whole. After ordering, you are sort of left in limbo, waiting in a makeshift line because they are eager to take the next order. I've often just had the bag thrown down on the counter in front of me without any indication that it's mine or another customers, until one of us checks it. Often have to ask multiple times for condiments or my drink, because they forgot to give it to me.\n\nThis review was written after literally going there multiple times per month, for about one year. I can't stand it anymore, I refuse to give them more of my money."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is located inside the Place Montreal Trust food court. It's a nice central location in a clean food-court - the staff are sometimes slow but it can get pretty overwhelming at lunch time. Like all McD's the menu is the same. I'm not going to be rating the food - you either like something here or don't. \n\nPart of my list of quick'n go Montreal spots."}
{"text":"Never went to Mcdonald? Are you Vegan?Against it? It's wrong to give them money? yeah yeah yeah...  It's what we call amongs us, Normal, a Guilty pleasure followed by a crappy discusting feeling in your tummy and a small down 'cause everything on their menu as crazy amount of Highly Modified Hardcore FRUCTOSE! \nWhy the 2 stars!?

We do stupid things like eating McDonald!  \n\nList of my Guilty pleasure:  Double Quarter Pounder Cheeseburger with extra bacon, no sauce/,mayo,  Trio with Fried, and Rootbeer and a 6 McNuggets extra with Honey SAUCE (it's not real Honey!)"}
{"text":"Consistently horrible service. Shake & cafe machines are seemingly always \"down\". Drive thru is excruciatingly slow & the employees are exceptionally chatty - with each other as opposed to helping us customers. I'm still perplexed as to why I have to ask for a receipt with my transaction. Shame on this location."}
{"text":"It was a hot sweltering day and as always this Macdonalds at 12:45 in the afternoon says the icecream  machine is broke. EVERYTIME I want to take a chance and go there to get icecream or a shake the machine is down.  Manager what is going on?  This is not sometime but just about all the time.  I have to go out to Macedonia ... this never happens out there.wonder why??"}
{"text":"A bit of history - this McDonalds is located on the first McDonalds I ever visited, back in the 1960's.  Back then, it was a special treat, now, not so much.  The menu is basic, but the service here could be better.  Sometimes OK, sometimes downright dreadful.  They need some additional training."}
{"text":"Wow... absolutely the worst, most shameful McDonald's I've ever been to.  I've had better customer service at McDonald's in airports, Walmarts, and in foreign countries where they didn't speak English, no exaggeration!\n\nDrive-thru window #1 cashier didn't say a single word, not a single greeting or smile.  She opened window, took payment, handed back receipt, then shut window.   And no, she wasn't busy - we were the only ones in the drive-thru.  No one before us, no one after.\n\nDrive-thru window #2 expediter mimicked the first - no hello, no thank you, nothing.  Only thing she said was, \"waiting on your nuggets.\"  That's it.  But she had plenty to say with her coworkers (one of whom I could tell was the shift supervisor) who were standing around being absolutely unproductive.\n\nTo add insult to injury, they also got our order wrong (wrong sauces) - minor, but still wrong especially with an order so small - only 1 entree!  (We ordered Chicken McNuggets and 2 sweet teas... pretty simple order!)\n\nAs a McDonald's alumnus myself I can rightfully say that this store's management should be ashamed of themselves and their franchise pulled until the store managers learn McDonald's standards for customer service."}
{"text":"I come for my mccafe ice coffe. And they manage too screw it up. Like how............ Then they all wanna have attitude... Including the \"managers\" they really need a reality check on who the have reppin them cause wow. Worst greet and services evaaaa.  Goodness may yhe forces be with you. Badda baappa baaaa im hatein it."}
{"text":"I always have problems at this McDonald's. They either forget my food in.my drive thru order, bad service or cold food...most recently I went to get an ice cream cone and the guys was grabbing/holding the cone with his bare hands all over it...so gross!"}
{"text":"As the only McDonalds in easy distance of a business district, this location gets pretty busy during lunch time.  Where they stand out from the other fast food in the area is that they handle the line with an extra employee walking down the line of cars with a touch screen handheld.  When the line gets clogged up, someone appears to take all the orders so things get moving again really quickly.  Taco Bell and co... get on board here!\n\nOther than that perk, it's a normal McDonalds.  You know what you're going to get and that's what you get."}
{"text":"Rachel was really polite. I loved her attitude. She knows what service is all about. Keep it up"}
{"text":"While the GM is fantastic,  the night crew is something else.  \n\nBasic math skills, Awareness of duties, common courtesy are all lacking. .\n\nOver many stops here, to the dark \"I am going to kill you\" parking lot. No light, (there but not on or burnt out) no bike racks, no security, transient asking for money, parking lot. \n\nWalk in to off duty employees joking with working ones, we wait, wait,  oh their not ordering,  free drinks though. \nFinally get to order, explain order the times, slow and articulated, give change to make even dollar back,  he asks why I have change. .\n\nWait to get a joke of order. (Vid) \n\nWe can deal with many things but lack of knowledge, training and carelessness are unacceptable."}
{"text":"Closest Mcdonalds to me. Staff is always friendly and I think it is 24 hours. Only downside is when I ordered a large drink the other day, I was waiting for at least 15 min."}
{"text":"I went with two co-workers here yesterday for lunch, and they gave me the wrong sandwich. I took it back to them and asked for the right food ( I HATE and cannot eat mayo, especially when it has like half of a bottle on it). They \"remade\" my sandwich and handed me back a \"corrected' chicken ranch blt... Well, when I sat down to enjoy my lunch, i realized it was the same one... They actually wiped off some of the mayo and covered it up with ranch. There was still mayo all over the bun and in the box. I have reported them to the health dept. That is so against the law!"}
{"text":"If a 0 star rating was a option that's what they would be getting. Whenever I go there I have to resist my order. I mostly go through drive thru, and almost every time when I get home I notice my order is wrong. This has happened at least 10 times. In one instance they had me wait in the summer heat and then told me they only accepted cash which almost no one carries. In another scenario we ordered ice cream only to find out the icecream machine was broken. Do not go to this horrible McDonald's"}
{"text":"I come here all the time and still don't get the level of customer service I get from any other restaurants.  How has McDonalds maintained at top compared to Wendy's?"}
{"text":"I'm not the best person to ask an opinion about when it comes to McDonalds. In fact I hate it. I quit eating it about ten years ago, that is until someone decided that after they took my order for Burger King and they weren't open that they would run here to get food. LAME.\n\nI wasn't going to be fussy and have a tantrum like a little kid, so I caved and let them bring me food from here. I can guarantee that I ate it like a two year old kid. I picked at it, played with it, complained about it, and if I could have, I would have fed it to a dog. However, I view that as animal cruelty.\n\nI give them kudos for attempting to be festive and mix the grease with leafy greens, but it still comes down to that nasty grease they fry everything in.  That's all my tongue sensed. I hated the food and then myself later that night as I made many trips to the bathroom, cursing each time. \n\nRemember, beggars can't be chooser. So when it comes to McDonalds, panhandle elsewhere."}
{"text":"It is a McDonald's in the middle of Oakland. It is a fast food chain and they are usually busy. The only good thing is that they are open 24 hours so you can always get your late night greasy snack! I had a coupon, so I went there. I wouldn't pick it for an every day meal."}
{"text":"this McDonald's is wild!!!! I cannot believe how WILD this McDonald's is. the tables do NOT connect to the wall. why. WHY. it also smell like doo doo, but my mcflurry was good."}
{"text":"Pretty much like most urban McDonald's. Decent service, the food just as you expect it. I just got a cheeseburger and the $1 large sweet tea to get out of the heat and work on my computer.\n\nThe store wasn't the cleanest when I was there. WiFi was very fast but outlets hard to find."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is so dirty. The food comes out good, but it's the same as McDonald's everywhere else. I try to limit my time in here because the floor looks gross and the tables are disgusting. One time I had to go to the bathroom super bad and I went into the one here and I turned around and left right away and decided it would be better to pee myself."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service all around. Manager flat out called me a liar over 20 chicken nuggets and refused to refund me. Will not go back"}
{"text":"Just like any McDonald's in US: cheap & convenient foods with unfriendly staffs. Guess what? I prefer McDonald's foods in Asian countries better."}
{"text":"I can't believe the nasty and ghetto things occurring at this store.  Wear gloves!! I wouldn't recommend you walk away from this micky D's"}
{"text":"This McDonald's is a really fast and efficient location especially for being on the strip. We stopped by here walking back to our hotel on a Saturday night around 9pm there was a good amount of people inside but they were just chillin for the AC lol."}
{"text":"Quick place to grab a cheap bite to eat no matter what time of day it is. The lines can get pretty long so bring your patience. The staff has always been friendly and with all the customers they see in a day that's amazing. They also have free wifi which is nice because all the surrounding Caesar's properties charge for it."}
{"text":"The food was fast And FRESH. But the customer service is HORRIBLE. the manager that was helping me was extremely rude and looked impatient. She was going to charge me for additional packages of sauce as well,she said the first sauce is free. But who eats a 20 piece nugget with 1 sauce?"}
{"text":"Horrible service... Wait for food is 20 min. I know it's just McDonalds but this is crazy. If they actually had to compete for business they would fail..."}
{"text":"I love McDonald BUT this one smelled like BO & shit, took 10 min for an order of fries, and why cashier didn't look happy to needing a translator to help an older lady put in her order - where is ur customer service?"}
{"text":"This is a pretty new McDonalds, so they're pretty much the same. The problem with this place is that there's a lot of homeless people late at night. Was there at 1am on a Thursday night (I know, what else should I expect?), and found 3 homeless people upstairs asleep at tables."}
{"text":"Convenient location on The Strip, next to Planet Hollywood. Great place to grab an inexpensive snack (e.g., nuggets) when strolling the shops and casinos, or a late night bite that's sometimes very needed when indulging in Sin City. Open 24/7.\n\nAlways BUSY, SUPER fast - seriously with a line of 20 peeps in front of you, still in and out in under 10 minutes with piping hot grub - and surprisingly remarkable friendly customer service. Huh!\n\nFor a fast food joint...A+. :)"}
{"text":"Up in early AM, and need a quick bite? I frequented this McD's for the $1 breakfast menu (gotta save the $ for gambling!) and there's always a ton of people since it's open 24 hours. Ride the escalator up and although there's a lot of people, it's organized and food comes out shortly after you order. Satisfied my morning cravings as always."}
{"text":"Wanted a quick breakfast but went a little late so got stuck with lunch items. What can I say. McDonald's is McDonald's"}
{"text":"The Las Vegas Strip is the adult Disney Land. And the majority of restaurants charge Disney Land prices for food. When I want to save money on the Strip, I will visit a fast food restaurant. Last night, I tried the newest McDonald's on the Strip.\n\n   This McDonald's opened a few weeks after the Harmon Road pedestrian overpass. It is located at the lower right corner of the new mall that went up at the northeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Harmon Road, below the new Harmon Road pedestrian bridge. It is a modern two-story McDonald's that would fit in at Midtown Manhattan. In contrast to the McDonald's about a block away the outside is more low key. Instead of giant arches there is only an \"M.\" With the exception of somebody asking me for change (expected on the Strip) it felt like I was eating in a classy fast food restaurant. The interior is modernism and everything is new.\n\n Kudos to McDonald's for keeping that price relative to the off strip locations. in my opinion paying approximately $8 for a ranch BLT value meal large size is worth it. \n\n   With restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip charging Disney Land prices, sometimes McDonald's will do. I see myself returning to the newest McDonald's on the Strip."}
{"text":"They tried to steal money from me!  Coming right from an ATM, all I had was $20 bills. I ordered $8.90 worth of food and the casheer gave me $1.10 back. He claimed that I gave him $10. When I said no, he made a loud fuss, had someone come by and said that the manager was going to count the drawer and see if there was extra money. After about 15 minutes, someone came back and said that the drawer had the right amount of money in it. I said I wanted to speak to the manager and they said ok. The manager never came out, but a large black man (that had been talking previously to the cashier) told me about a story where someone made a \"big deal out of nothing and one person went crazy on that person\". I assumed that he was talking about me and my missing $10, so I asked him what he was here for and if he was going to buy anything. After another 15 minutes, the came out and told me that they had recounted and realized that they were $10 over. They then gave me my money. The cashier made a condescending remark to me and I left. I believe his name was Lorenzo."}
{"text":"Worst McDonalds that I have ever been to. Weird and rude staff. I don't know who, in the god's name, hired them."}
{"text":"A female employee did not close the coffee lid tight, so when I grabbed the coffee cup, it spilled on my hand and my hand got burned.  Despite of my shout in pain, she did not give any attention and ignored my request to close the coffee lid tight for the customers.  @#$%^&*!!!!!  Horrible service!"}
{"text":"You're in foody paradise, so there is not much reason to come to McDonald's,  But, it is the standard fare at the standard prices, including their wonderful coffee.  The service is excellent, and the dining room is clean.  So, come and sober up with a cup of joe!"}
{"text":"McDonalds is McDonalds.. Great meal on the strip for a great price. Escalator didn't work so we weren't able to bring our luggage. But good for what you get. Plus really fresh cold water!"}
{"text":"It's a very unique and very conveniently located McDonald's. Almost seems as it is part of the same building as Harrah's. Although they are really open 24/7, their entire menu is not available at all times. In my opinion and I love their breakfast most of all, they switch way too early in the morning. A few nights it was 4:00 a.m. on other nights by 3:30 a.m they had already switched to breakfast. During weekdays you will have no problem finding a table for yourself and your family. On the weekends, however, good luck. There is seating upstairs, downstairs and outside. Still was difficult to find a table for just myself on the weekend. Primarily in the morning. Other than the cool arch, it's your typical McDonald's. If this location isn't close to your hotel, fret not my dear friend on a budget, there is literally a McDonald's everywhere on The Strip."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst McDonald's I've been to."}
{"text":"drunk fools at 5:30 am and the staff is going strong as the cashier announces \"ladies and gentleman, we'll be changing to our breakfast menu in 30 minutes!\""}
{"text":"It's Vegas. People are already walking outside. It's kinda crowded and it's only about 830AM. I was hesitant to see all the people standing inside but I needed to get something quick and simple for my boyfriend.\n\nLet me tell you; I was in/out in maybe 5 minutes tops! I ordered two egg white breakfast sandwiches, two large orange juices, and a side order of pancakes. I ordered, walked off to go stand in a corner and my order was ready! I was blown away!\n\nStaff are quick, efficient, and on-point. Kudos to all these employees for working so hard and fast to cater to everyone down here!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the hot and spicy mcchicken and free wifi.\n\n-Service sucked.\n-Dining area was filthy.\n-The guy moping the floor didnt know how to ring out a mop right.\n\nThey have a number on receipts for customers so they know which order they are. The guy calling out customer's orders wasnt even calling out numbers he was saying the items on a customers order. The people waiting right next to me were confused because some of them also ordered the same thing I did. Most of the staff looked like they didnt really give a damn about their job. I wouldnt give a damn neither if I was working at a McDonalds at 3am in the morning."}
{"text":"The New Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich, is horrible! The chicken patty is extremely thin and the batter has no flavor! The only thing that was tasteful was the bun. Please place this item on the dollar menu. To charge four dollars and change for this item is robbery."}
{"text":"This review is only for the strawberry milkshake. \n\nWe stumbled into this mcdonalds because the girlfriend had a sudden craving for Mickey d strawberry milkshake. When we got it, the presentation was ok, but the taste....there was a terrible artificial taste to it, almost as if it was made with 90% stevia and 10% milk. \n2 stars, since the shake itself looked (misleadingly) decent."}
{"text":"You would think that McDonald's on the Vegas strip would know what their customers want at 3AM in the morning. Unfortunately they do not. For some reason this McDonald's did not have a late night menu. They switch to a breakfast only menu way to early in the night!"}
{"text":"The food is good however the service is not the best... Be VERY specific and talk slow when you order. Seriously. \nI ordered a mcdouble with cheese and mayo only. And got a slice of cheese with mayonnaise no meat. :/ other than that food is good cheap fast and convenient. Especially if you work nearby!"}
{"text":"Usual McDonald's food at usual prices. I'm not usually a big fast food burger guy but I'll come here to get coffee and breakfast in the morning when I'm staying at a nearby hotel. This place is CROWDED in the morning but they do move FAST so the wait isn't too bad. Plan to get it to go though since they place is full at breakfast time. Eat, get your caffeine, save your money, and get back to enjoying Vegas."}
{"text":"This McDonald's was across the street from the Cosmopolitan where I was staying at. I think this was the closest one to me. I ended up coming here twice for breakfast during my last trip to vegas. The location of this McDonald's is really good. It's located right off the street. The inside of the place was nice. They had two levels for additional seating upstairs since there wasn't that much downstairs. The food and service was good. Came here for breakfast and ordered sausage mcmuffins and hash browns.\n\nThis place wasn't packed and the lines weren't that long. So it was good that we didn't have to wait long for our food each time we went. Definitely a good place to stop to get a bite to eat quick and easy. Prices are what you would expect so at least you aren't getting ripped off for expensive bagels, muffins or croissants! I'll probably stop by here again if I stay near this place the next time I go to vegas."}
{"text":"Came in to grab breakfast.  The whole team at this McDonald's was working together and delivered a quick. Fast hot and pleasant experience.   Great job!"}
{"text":"This McDonald's is located in such a good spot on the strip. My friends and I were staying near the Cosmo and needed a quick bite for dinner before we started getting ready to go out at night.\n\nWe came here after seeing the long lines at Secret Pizza in the Cosmo, and boy did this hit the spot! Food-wise, it was all pretty standard, but I was impressed with the quick and efficient service as well as the cleanliness of the restaurant. \n\nWe didn't have to wait too long before our food was ready, and the five of us happily chowed down on a bunch of Filet o'Fish, spicy chicken sandwiches, and sausage and egg sandwiches (woohoo I love breakfast all day!!). The best part was that we were in and out of there in 30 minutes or so.\n\nThere's a Walgreens right next door so we stopped by there afterwards to stock up on water and alcohol. Killed two birds with one stone, not bad!"}
{"text":"Fairly clean, bit slow service, but free refills and free WiFi - the latter a $12 value!"}
{"text":"I feel jiped on the fries and they didn't have the toy my daughter wanted but I don't see much difference in this McDonald's compared to other McDonald's."}
{"text":"Being Vegas and all restaurants assuming you just hit the mega-millions jackpot, it's nice to see some lower priced food ON the Strip. There's definitely better food out there, but in a bind, not so bad. It was over 100 degrees today so I came in for a cone. Again, not a terrible place to take a load off... but I'd suggest hanging out in a shopping area (i.e. the Forum or Palazzo Shoppes) if you'd like to just sit to wait for someone. This McDonald's can get quite busy and crowded.\n\nWith that said, it's what you would expect. Fast food. Nothing special about this particular location."}
{"text":"I strongly recommend only eating here if your hotel is close enough for you to take the food back there to eat it. It's ridiculously loud inside, and the patio tables outside are covered with pigeon droppings (didn't stop anyone from eating out there, which blew my mind) Service and food is standard McD's of course, but consider it to-go only."}
{"text":"This location at Harmon and the Harrahs location, have the worst service, employee attitudes and unqualified managers. I wrote complaint last year and one this month they do not follow up. The employees feel they do you a favor by coming to work. Floors tables dirty. Bathroom closed most of the time.\nToday the manager Miguel was not only rude also lazy. He was the cashier when I paid I asked for water cup he said ask when your food is ready. Can't believe the managers they hire."}
{"text":"C'est pas un Macdo, c'est la bourse de New York, enfin Vegas....\nA 9h du mat, √ßa crie dans tous les sens le nom des commandes. Il y a m√™me des employ√©s qui vous acceuillent et vous dirigent vers les files d'attentes.\nRendement maximal oblige.\nLe Macdo du Strip reste cependant l'une des meilleures options pour un petit dej pas cher et rapide."}
{"text":"I ate a cheeseburger here that gave me an awful asthma attack. I'm sensitive to preservatives used in beef or sausage, and sometimes (about once a year) I do get sick when eating out. However, I've never had an attack while eating at McDonald's in my life. Usually, it's a food preservative at a dine-in restaurant that will set it off an asthma attack. \n\nA week later, I also had an asthma attack eating a McDonald's crispy chicken sandwich in TN.  Perhaps they've changed their recipe? Changed food preservatives? \n\nRegardless, I need to give up fast food anyway, it's so bad for you. I don't smoke/live with smokers, and I've never had an asthma attack from food I cooked at home. That's why I think it must be something restaurants use in food as a preservative. This is the first time I've been sick from chicken."}
{"text":"Make sure to double check your order! I didn't get any sauce with my McNuggets even though it was on the receipt.  I only realized it after I got back to my hotel room.\n\nAlso, they didn't ask if I wanted pie. They are supposed to ask you; otherwise  you are entitled to a free one.  I didn't want to cause trouble, but it's obvious that the customer service is lacking when people stop by from the clubs."}
{"text":"In the three days I was in Vegas I went to Mc Donalds five times. Four out of the five times was at this location. I told myself that I would not go to Mc Dinalds but I have to admit how handy this place was. Sometimes when your drunk and hungry a fifthteen dollar burger isnt going to cut it, sometimes you just need a dollar menu. Great location. Get filled up for less here."}
{"text":"Gah! Worst McDonald's I've ever been to!\n\nA minor nitpick is that they have an escalator up to the restaurant, but not down to the bottom. (They do have an elevator)\n\nThe cashier that we ordered with was very friendly and talkative, which is why this gets one star, otherwise, I would wish I could give 0. First, they got our order almost completely wrong. We ordered a Sausage McMuffin; and a Bacon, Egg, and cheese McGriddle. Instead, we got an Egg McMuffin; and a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Biscuit, so we had to take that back to get that fixed. The bread on the sandwiches was overly dry and tough, as well...\n\nTo top things off, while we were in the middle of eating, we had a most unpleasant experience of a cockroach scurrying out by our table, causing all of us to jump and immediately leave the inside of the restaurant to eat outside on the patio. I will never eat at this McDonald's again when we're going through Vegas."}
{"text":"Komplett voll an einem normalen Wochentag. \nVon der Sauberkeit okay \n\nPommes aber leider kalt. \nHamburger lauwarm.\n\nUnd ein komisches abhol system. \n\nAlso wenn man Geld sparen m√∂chte okay. Aber ansonsten nicht empfehlenswert."}
{"text":"I was able to get Mickey Dee's breakfast AND french fries!  It was schizophrenic!"}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's I've ever went!!!! So the line wasn't very long when I was there with my cousin. We saw that the cash register was broken and we understood that it will take longer. The thing that I didn't like was that there where around 15 employees there and only one took care of the orders and she had to write the orders by hand...poor girl! I felt really bad for her, everybody was just watching her and her co-workers didn't help! Management is poor there! The line got really long and people got upset, too! I ordered mc nuggets and then they forgot my sauce, too! I'm definitely not coming back here!!"}
{"text":"We came here for a quick early breakfast during our brief stay in Las Vegas  recently.  There was a line to  order but the people were efficient.  The breakfast biscuits we got met my expectations of the brand. We been here years ago and will most likely visit again on our future trips to the Strip."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly for a McDonalds and food was quick since most ingredients were precooked.  However, the southern chicken biscuit was precooked so much it was disgustingly dry.  The patty was tough and chewy.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"OMG never had such a shitty burger ( bbq ranch burger) threw up in my mouth: always have loved mcdonalds 4-5 stars but have to review that shit (literally would probably eat shit) than eat the bbq ranch burger!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for a late night snack and escape the high prices of the strip.  It was very crowded when I went, but true to the fast food industry name, my order came out very quick."}
{"text":"3 stars for hot n spicy McChickens."}
{"text":"Long lines, rude service and prices that are \"adjusted\" for tourists. Come on Mcdonalds! You can do better than this lame excuse. If you want to get ripped off go to this Mcdonalds.. otherwise there are better options near the strip"}
{"text":"The food was pretty average. The place was rather dimly lit. The establishment itself wasn't very clean. The floors were sticky, especially near the soda machines.\n\nNot sure what else to say, except I guess at wee hours of the night, it's a familiar place to go."}
{"text":"This is the best Mickey D's I have ever frequented! They have tables with flowers! The food looks perfect, like it's straight out of the commercial. Plus, I got coffee & a waitress actually walked around the place refilling peoples coffee, like a diner. Wholly sugar balls! That's classy."}
{"text":"This Mc Donalds is nothing special, the line gets pretty long, but they are always fast to give you your food. They cheated me out of my $1 Sweet Tea though and gave me a small cup. There are also alot of bums out there, but it is Vegas, and it is cheap food. They go hand in hand."}
{"text":"Worse service wait 30 mins to order and wait 30 mins for your food for more than a normal McDonald's I'll drive down the street this was horrible nasty location for how much we pay."}
{"text":"This is the greatest McDonald's ever. I love it so much. Whenever I'm visiting 'Sconsin, I'm going to stop at this McD. =)"}
{"text":"Most McDonalds are the same, so it's hard to write a review. I have always had a great experience at this location...I would tie it with the McDs on Odana Road as the best location in the area. Good service, fast drive-through, and never had an issue with my order. It is also 50s diner themed."}
{"text":"This might be the best run McDonalds in the Madison area. The drive-through runs incredibly fast! Plus, it's a throw back McDonalds with a displayed old milkshake machine that triggered Ray Kroc's involvement in the company, and resulted in him bringing in a franchise model that facilitated the restaurant's world-wide domination. However, who checks for a McDonalds rating?"}
{"text":"I can't believe I am writing a review for a McDonalds, but we recently drove through here the other day for a diet coke......as others have said, they are fast.  It a 50's style retro McD's but the customer service is excellent, and the drive through was wicked fast."}
{"text":"This is probably the best run McD's I have ever been in. Service is fast, friendly and the food is always great (for McD's). It is a high quality restaurant and should be a flagship for their brand."}
{"text":"It's a McDonalds.  Bit of a 50's theme.  Always use the bathroom and it's always clean.  Decent service."}
{"text":"Hard to rate a McDonald's well.  I go through the drive thru most mornings for coffee and will eat lunch there from time to time.  Drive thru service is always great and restaurant is always clean.  They hire and retain good help."}
{"text":"I frequent the McDonald's as I live on Greenway Blvd. The service is an example of what every McDonald's should be like. Efficient, competitively price, fresh. They always provide me with an accurate order."}
{"text":"I honestly don't really love McDonald's but I do like their breakfast.  This McDonald's tops all of other McDonald's I've ever been to for service and happy employees!"}
{"text":"Food was good, however some lady who works there (drive threw) condescended me so that was annoying."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced because well it's McDonald's... Where you can fill out a previous receipt for buy one get one Egg Mcmuffin or Quarter pounder with cheese. I fill out the surveys on my smart phone in under 2 minutes. Zip thru with the quick honest answers and fill out the code on top. Great penny pincher.\n\nOther way I used to save is order a Mcdouble, no ketchup, no mustard, extra pickle add mac sauce for .25 cents you're welcome.\n\nPlus you can't beat that they have free Wi-Fi here.  Place to stop, charge your batteries, eat, surf on the laptop and don't drink soda if you've been drinking. You'll drop like a fly.. Stay hydrated Las Vegas.  I drink tap and squeeze two lemons or get a $1 sweet tea.\n\nYes. You see the homeless everywhere. I've been known to be generous with supplying a water or get them food if they are respectful about asking.."}
{"text":"Food is good but staff/service is HORRENDOUS. Every single time I go there they mess up my order, in my opinion they need to hire all new staff. And when I complained, I got attitude from the manager. Worst McDonald's."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if I can.. Workers on 12/2/16 at 10:25am are a bunch of id..ts! They get my whole order very wrong even after repeating it twice to them.. They make us wait 20 minutes on the side and on top of that giving unnecessary attitude. Yall want to get raises and also forget to put straws in my bag for my drinks.."}
{"text":"2015 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 070/100\n\nWow, this was a cluster f*ck of epic proportions. Firstly, we waited in the drive thru for over 25min. So we decided, lets park instead, i'm sure i'll be easier inside. However inside there was a line to the back wall. They were super busy, and they were working super hard, but even the manager apologized to us because they only had 4 people working. Why? That's unacceptable seeing as though it took us about 45min to get out of there."}
{"text":"Employees are super nice.  But the place is always dirty.  Food everywhere and people blowing there nose gross.  It's very nasty.  If it was cleaned more often after people it would help"}
{"text":"Obviously a business that thrives on one-time only visits (i.e. tourists), I'm a local and I won't  be going back.\n1.  Drive-thru took about 20 mins.\n2.  I ordered only one thing ... a classic grilled chicken sandwich, was one of the driest sandwiches I've ever had.\n3.  The help can't speak nor understand English.\nI guess I shouldn't be that surprised, oh well."}
{"text":"horrible customer service...we were there sat after the club and after getting one of my husband orders wrong..the ass hat of the drive through guy came to yell at us and this was not ok. we have never been treated soon badly at a fast food drive through.  this happened at 07/30/16 at 2:30 am  they need to fire him and I wish I knew this punks name."}
{"text":"An \"A-OK\" McDonalds... if you're leaving the Strip and need to stop by McDonalds for some breakfast (or quick lunch/dinner), this is a decent place to stop by. The seating is a bit strange as they've replaced the normal tables and benches with what looks to be an attempt for a more modern look... but it makes the seating a bit uncomfortable. The food tastes like standard McDonald's food and the staff were generally nice."}
{"text":"I wouldn't give any stars if I could. We were in line through the drive-thru for 5 minutes. The lady asked us what we wanted and we started to order, then all of a sudden she says \"Hold on\". Couple pulled up behind us, then someone pulled up in the 2nd lane. The drive-thru lady asked the 2nd lane \"How may I help you?\" We waited a little longer to see if anyone would help us, but NO ONE DID!!! So we drove through and went to Wendy's instead. SCREW YOU MCDONALDS!!!"}
{"text":"Not that McDonald's is a high end restaurant to begin with but I feel like a little customer service is necessary. Worst place ever! I'd rather eat food from a gas station to not have to deal with these people. I sat down to eat and had just gotten my food when a manager comes up and tells me there is a 30 minute sitting. Damn lady chill out I just barley sat down. They are rude and the orders are never right. And the owners could care less."}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 73/100***\n\nI've never done a 1 star review as I never felt I've had an experience so horrible that warrants that, I always try to find the silver lining and highlight the positive. That has changed as of yesterday at around 3:30 PM, I guess there's a first for everything.\n\nWe ordered from drive thru, a part of that order is a PLAIN cheeseburger and a Quarter pound with cheese NO PICKLES. He repeated the order and I confirmed what was displayed on their order monitor. So I drove away thinking everything is good because why wouldn't it be, right? WRONG! I dropped my husbands food to him and left, only to be told by my daughter that her cheeseburger has ketchup. When I checked, it was the total opposite of plain, it had EVERYTHING on it: ketchup, mustard, pickles and onions like I had asked for the total opposite. REALLY??? So I decided to drive back over there since it was on the way. We went inside, I spoke with the manager Alejandra and she gave me a new one. No apologies, NOTHING! She acted like I was the one inconveniencing her. \n\nI brushed it off, it was not worth my aggravation. Since we were already there we decided to just finish our meal there, then I get a text from my husband informing me they had put pickles on his burger! ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? At this point I was livid already, I went back to the register and asked for the manager AGAIN. I told her they put pickles when I specifically asked for NO PICKLES because my husband is allergic to it. She asked me for the receipt, I told her I threw it away but if she was skeptical, to ask her drive thru employee and he can vouch for my order since we were there not even 15 minutes ago. She then tells me it's their policy not to address any issues without a receipt, no refunds only exchanges. WHAT?!? I have never heard of such policy at a food place. I was disgusted at that point, I told her I didn't want any replacement or my money back but a fair warning as that issue could have gone south fast. You cannot mess around with peoples lives like that. Anaphylactic reactions are no joke, someone could seriously get hurt because your employee decided he/she doesn't really care about their job. I'm pretty sure the franchise owners wouldn't want that kind of mess in their hands. The thing that really irked me the most was her half ass apology and the smirk she had on her face. All I wanted was a sincere apology and she couldn't even give me that, because on top of my husband's would have been allergic reaction had he not check his burger but thanks to them he now didn't have lunch either.\n\nObviously there is a disconnect between the people that take your order and the ones that actually prepare them. It's not rocket science, read the damn order slip!!! This place is a lawsuit waiting to happen!\n\nAlso an advice to the management: PLEASE train your managers properly, they are the face of your company/franchise. Learn manners and how to handle a situation accordingly! UGHHHH!!!"}
{"text":"With all the negative reviews here, I don't know if my review would even matter. Lol But ill do it anyway for the sake of yelp... :)\n\nThis is in regards of the drive thru service. I went here for lunch. I like the idea that they have 2 drive thru order thingy to speed up the line.\n\nThe lady who was taking my order was inattentive. I was giving her my orders and I can hear her talking to someone. And then she'll ask me what's my order. wth. I had to repeat myself like 3x. Girl, listen to me! \n\nSo she got my order, finally. Went up to the first window to make my payment. This lady opened her window, did not even say hi or confirmed my total. Just waiting for me to hand her my form of payment.. WTH! I confirmed my total with her, she's like \"yup\" ! Gave her money, a minute later she handed me my receipt without any thank you or eye contact. Unbelievable customer service..\n\nGot up to the next window to get my order hoping for a nice lady who will turn my experience into a better one...\n\nWell, she didn't made it worse, she didn't made it better either.. Lol. They're all the same. No hi, hello, no thank you, no eye contact. Were they ever trained??? Oh well.. And of course, no ketchup for my fries!! Which I forgot that Mcdonalds doesnt give ketchups unless you ask.... How sad is that for a forgetful person like me....."}
{"text":"The cashier's are most likely half retarded or something. They messed up 3 different orders of mine. Have no idea how they even have that extra half star. This place blows."}
{"text":"One of the most ghetto McDonald's I've ever been in. Got French fries and an iced coffee, and they forgot about my order so I had to go up to the counter to remind them about it."}
{"text":"Dropped by with the coworkers for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised at how relatively nicer the interior of this McD is. From the modern tables and seating to the silk orchids and the 1947 Harley Davidson on display in the middle of the dining area, this is definitely an excellent remodeling job.\n\nCustomer service is friendly, but they are prone to messing up the orders (hot coffee instead of iced, missing hash browns missing from the breakfast meal orders), which they will remedy as long as you bring it to their attention. Still a hassle.\n\nAnyway, it is the closest and easiest McD to get to and back from during our break, so we'll still be back.\n\nCleanliness: 4.5/5\nAmbiance: 5/5\nCustomer Service: 2.5/5\n\n3 stars."}
{"text":"The worst experience with a McDonald's ever. By the time our car got to the drive thru window it was exactly 10:30am. We wanted breakfast but they said they stopped breakfast at 10:30. The crazy part is the menu still showed ALL breakfast items.  \n\nWe asked if she could switch the menu to the lunch and she said an employee has to do that. So I asked her to read the lunch menu off to us, thinking that she wouldn't do it, and she did! Lol she started reading the entire lunch menu.\n\nFinally we ordered and next issue was drive thru was taking forever! They said they were waiting on the chicken wrap since they just switched from breakfast. So then they make us pull forward to the front so we can wait. We counted 7 cars that got their food and drove thru while we waited for about 10 minutes. \n\nFinally after a grand total of 20 minutes a lady opens the door and just sticks her hand out with the food. Doesn't say anything, no \"sorry\" or \"here you go\" or \"thank you\"\n\nSo we just grabbed the bag and left. Such a bad experience. I'm probably going to get food poisoning from eating what I just ate. \n\nWish me luck"}
{"text":"I just dropped 16 for two meals they are SO BURNT they are unable to be eaten. \nThis McDonalds doesnt seem to have a cook last week my egg mc muffin the egg was brown it was so overcooked"}
{"text":"Worst MacDonalds ever, don't have smoothies, ice mocha or anything cold and then to top it off I do ask to switch from hash browns to regular fries because I don't like hash browns and the cashier its hesitant to aproach the manager and when she does she just said no, plain no, never coming back"}
{"text":"Worst fastfood restaurant ever. Get in the drive through and no one talked to me. Stuck in there for 20 mins for nothing. Fucking dumb ass restaurant"}
{"text":"We we're from CA and we just stopped by there today to buy breakfast before driving home. I ordered a breakfast combo but asked for mocha instead of regular coffee. The guy who took our order was nice but this Hispanic lady (I'm not being racist, I just want to describe her coz I didn't get her name) gave our order. Long story short, she said I didn't order mocha. In our receipt it says coffee and additional fee for upgraded coffee.  Yes she gave me a small mocha with attitude & She Wants to charge me again. So I showed my receipt. She responded to me with attitude and she was bossy with the cashiers to go back on taking other people's order coz the guy who took my order was trying to help me. She has attitude, nasty, arguing & yelling to us in front of other customers & kids. I hope she is not the branch manager there coz she was wearing a different (blue) uniform. You can't have that kind of job and position if you're dealing with customers. I will never ever come back there again. From the very beginning she was already frowning and looks angry and unprofessional. People go somewhere else but there."}
{"text":"Sad to say, I have seen worse.  It's convenient and relatively fast. Just not clean as it could be.\n\nThe staff here are almost as depressed as the homeless people you find hanging around it"}
{"text":"The workers in this mcdonalds lack customer service. Can't even look at you when they are taking  orders, no wonder this place is empty."}
{"text":"Rude staff and cold fries! I would have given one star but the inside looks nice. Modern and clean. My friend was told she could get iced coffee with her meal with no extra charge then was charged $1 extra."}
{"text":"Went to the closest Mc'D's for breakfast this a.m.  On W. Tropicana near I 15.  Gave my order and requested a cup of hot water.  It took a long time to get the order. I was reviewing  the receipt and notice a charge for $1.20. Questioned the counter person, who was clueless and then let the supervisor know that this is wrong. They say it is SOP to charge for a cup of hot water.  Stop at another Mc'D for another reason, and I questioned one of the employees. He said \"No, they shouldn't be charging for hot water.  A cup maybe, not hot water.  I think the owner of this store is trying to nickel and dime the public for everything. All condiments, with the exception of straws are controlled by the counter help.  Hope corporate McDonalds will look into this store. McDonalds Store #5240. Avoid if possible."}
{"text":"Typical McDonald's.  I like this location because it is an easy to get just off the strip location.  It is perfect for a quick inexpensive breakfast.  Drive-thru is on pair with most \"quick drive-thru's\".  Interior is Harley-Davidson themed for those that like to look at things while they wait for food."}
{"text":"I had a pleasant experience for the most part except the cashier. She was slow and didn't know what she was doing, maybe she was new but didn't even have a smile on her face and that alone is a negative for me. There was a man sweeping up, cleaning around, and everytime some one was done he'd ask if you were done and if so he offered to take your tray. How many Mc Donald's do that? Not many. Also he was signing and had a happy face to be there just doing his job. Too bad I didn't get his name but he was great. Also the location isn't the nicest."}
{"text":"Close enough to the Strip that the prices are jacked up, sometimes severely, like 75 cents extra for a sausage Mcmuffin.\n\nOn the plus side, it's clean, the restroom is usually in good shape and doesn't require buzzing, and it's the only McDs I've ever seen with a Harley mounted in the middle of the lobby for some reason"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful customer service. Rudest employee ever. Since when can I only get breakfast at 2:30 am by the way??? Such bullshit this place was tonight."}
{"text":"WORST EVER!!!!!!!!!!!  Don't bother!!!!!!!!!  \nGo to the other 100 near it.  Phone is always busy too.  Managers get off your a**!! \nArgumentative staff."}
{"text":"I would you guys negative stars if I could.   You obviously rely on one time guest who will never see you again.  I happen to be a local and have had 3 bad experiences on 3 trips.  Your drive thru attendants pay no attention to what is ordered and are rude.  My bag was thrown to me tonight without my drinks and the girl came back to the window and said \"what?\"   Unbelievable.  Nail in the coffin, opened my bag and not only did they get my order wrong but the manager seemed completely unapologetic and could care less when I called.   By looking at the other ratings it's clear this was not a one time occurrence.  I will never visit this location again EVER.   It's clear the issue is the management.    Avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"This is short. I hear advertised for breakfast. Well it's limited on selection. There aren't any Mcgriddles. That is NOT ok. That to me is the best and only thing I will eat there. I recently had to break down after about a year of not going and my wonderful husband got me lunch because I forgot mine. I work swing nights. Breakfast sounded real good. Well no MCgriddles. That is sad and this particular location is just bad period. I settled for an egg mcmuffin and hash brown. Put it this way I had a bit of each and spit the hard dry hash out. Ijs. I read another review and they sd because they are on or near the strip and ppl will more or less come once to this establishment, is not a reason to have sucky food. Ok this isn't short. But it's my short! Lol"}
{"text":"Who waits 15 minutes for 2 EggMcMuffin breakfast meals at McDonald's??\nAND THEN...gets 2 Sausage McMuffin meals??  That's me!!  I should never have even considered walking into this place after seeing homeless drug addicts hanging out right beside the door asking for handouts.\n\nIt was a Sunday morning around 8:30am.  I was in a hurry and McDonald's is usually a place where you know what you're going to get in regards to food and service.  Not here!!  There were other customers trying to get their orders straightened and the manager was trying to encourage other employees to get their act together but it was coming out all wrong.  It was chaos!"}
{"text":"2 hours to get a mcchicken. Food was cold and manager didn't care about the poor service"}
{"text":"Came here on a short re-feul from gambling all night/morning - breakfast never tasted so good (that I can remember).\n\nBottomline: it seemed pretty clean in here. It's a McDonald's."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars that would describe this store. Manager was very rude order was not correct and tried to say that's what we ordered. I asked for my money back and to cancel the order and was told no refund. I did get my refund and promised I would never be back"}
{"text":"If yelp were to ever allow zero stars, this would be the first I would have to update immediately. \n\nWent to this McDonalds yesterday morning around 6:30AM to order two hash browns at the drive thru. The response \"okay\" my boyfriend and I received made us think this cashier must really hate life. Fine, whatever it's 6 am on a Monday, everyone can have a bad day. We pull up to the window and she confirms our order before charging us. When my boyfriend checked the receipt however it was way more items than our two hash browns, so we kindly stated that we think she charged us for the wrong order. Then she went full bitch on us and with hella attitude and disdain said she just asked if the order was right. We pointed out that the receipt didn't match and she snatches the receipt out of our hands and then replies, \"that's because it's the wrong receipt\" in a tone like it was our fault that she handed us the wrong receipt before flinging it back into our window. \n\nI tried to check for a name badge and didn't see one nor a cashier name on the receipt to call a manager about the piss poor excuse of not only an employee but of a person they hired, but after skimming the other reviews on this location I doubt it'd make a difference. Seems like this McDonald's simply has no fucks to give."}
{"text":"Small, but clean. Staff is rude. Remember the show \"Seinfeld\" instead of a soup nazi the woman, maybe the manger is a condiment nazi."}
{"text":"Where do I start... Oh yeah. The people watching at this place is wonderful. The abundance of tweekers and crackheads is amazing. With that aside, it's a Mcdonalds! That's all I have to say about the food. The service was not good at all , the staff seemed overwhelmed with a small lunch rush. My order was missing a hamburger ( the main part of one of the meals I ordered), an apple juice (part of a kids meal) and cup for one of the drinks. They did fix it quickly. Oh there was an employee in the dinning area making the floor super sticky ( I think she was mopping with a mop bucket that had cleaned up a spilled soda, just a guess) so that was nice. So I would definitely would not recommend you try this particular McDonald's.  In and out it's just across the street."}
{"text":"It took about 1 hour for a burger, can you believe it, it's FASTFOOD!"}
{"text":"Not the best you'll find but not the worse either.  I'm here for the vanilla shake.  Nice Harley-Davidson theme inside (not sure what the connection is).  \n\nAnd I'm really here for some International tid-bits:\nLet's try Austria.\nMcDonald's launched two noodle offerings in Austria in 2012.  This was a world premiere to test consumer demand for the Asian dish.\n\n\"McNoodles\" went on sale at its Austrian restaurants in a test, set to last two to three months.\n\nThe meals feature noodles with vegetables, chicken, salad and either sweet-and-sour or curry sauce, and will cost around 4.99 euros ($6.56).\n\nThe company said it hoped to tap a trend toward noodle dishes and show off its ability to innovate by launching the products, which it will import from Thailand.\n\nThree-quarters of the products sold by McDonald's Austria are developed locally, and the latest experiment was prompted by the growing popularity of noodle dishes there.\n\nU.S.-based McDonald's has 179 restaurants in Austria that generated sales of 515 million euros last year."}
{"text":"Drive thru takes 10 years to order and takes a long time for them to respond. And at the payment window, the girl who were there did not smile at all. At least say thank you before I leave.. That lady that I saw looks really angry about something. Probably hate her job... I wish that the store manager would do a proper training with them, seriously. Bad customer service. Never going there again"}
{"text":"McDonalds has not the best reputation but this has been the worst fast food experience of my lifetime.\n\nBesides waiting 20 minutes for a Big Mac, I witnessed a customer treatening to hit a member of staff. I am not sure what happened as I only arrived when the customer said he would \"hit him later\" and then left.\n\nThen staff members began shouting at each other about using each other's cashier machines. \n\nIt was so obvious that the staff were untrained and completely unprofessional. The manager seemed to have lost control and was berating staff in front of other customers."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I drove through this location on our way out of Las Vegas and back home.  My review is based on the drive-through experience.  For your normal McDonald's food, cheap price, then I woiuld recommend to give this a try.  Especially in vegas, this helps the wallet.\n\nMy thing is \"Customer Service\".  They need to be better alert when moving people onto the next window after paying.  There are two windows, and all they say is move ahead.  Then you wait, wait, wait, wait, and wait.  All the while, you are wondering if you are at the right window.\n\nYou finally get your food, but if this were fixed it would be a perfect score!"}
{"text":"We visited this location on Monday 5/25 and my daughter left her phone in the bathroom. We didn't realize this until we got back to our home in California and she told us at 11pm (right at closing time). I tracked her phone with an app and called the restaurant right away. The manager who answered said it wasn't turned in and refused to look for it, even though I told him I could see it was still there. So the next morning I called again and got a new manager this time, LaKiko Spaight. She said she also didn't see it in lost and found but agreed to take my information in case someone found it or turned it in. A half hour later she called me and had found my daughter's phone. I was so happy. But then she did something I didn't expect. She offered to mail it to me. Last night I received a phone call from her that she had just left the post office and paid to send my daughter's phone back to her. I am absolutely going to reimburse her for that cost but I couldn't let that act of kindness go unnoticed. She went above and beyond and my family is so grateful to know people like her still exist in this world. You are so lucky to have her as an employee and she deserves recognition for her kindness. Thank you."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if it was an option. This was by far the worst McDonald's I have ever been to. There's no menu board to even order from at the drive thru and when we pulled up the man on the speaker told us to pull up to the window and he would take our order there. When we got to the window I asked for a menu and he told us they didn't have one and to just order and he's tell us if they had what we wanted. So I ordered chicken nuggets since I knew they would have that and before I was done ordering the man cut me off and told me what the total would be. I then told him we had more to order and he gave me a dirty look and took the rest of my order. Eventually he gave us our food and the chicken nuggets tasted as if they had been sitting under the warmer all day and then the quarter pounder my husband received was basically just the meat and bun besides one pickle and like 3 or four small shredded pieces of lettuce. McDonald's isn't my first choice to eat at but it was one of the only places open at the time. I don't recommend anyone come here."}
{"text":"The worst McD's EVER!  Took 20 min for 2 coffees, & they couldn't get it right.  Everything about it was bad, slow, irritating."}
{"text":"Yikes! This McDonald's is sketch as hell! Especially at night but since I work in the casino business you can work all kind of hours! Anyways that's besides the fact that I pulled up late one night after work and there were some really suspect people hanging out by the ordering menu in the drive thru trying to get my attention to I guess beg for some money? But the fact that all three of them were hooded was a little shady anyways I had to wait about 5 minutes until the girl taking orders was ready for me but in the mean time I had my windows rolled up and doors locked! After I placed my order I requested a sausage biscuit and just an FYI they don't serve these until AFTER 4AM.. Once I pulled to the window the girl was obviously sleepy because there was no such thing as customer service.. But it's McDonald's so what can I say?...."}
{"text":"I like this place cuz the play area is huge!  Lots of seating, twice as much as some places."}
{"text":"I like the 2-5 mc cafe 1 dollar off deals right now.  It's really the only thing I get here.  I can get an iced coffee in the afternoon for 90 cents.  Can't beat that"}
{"text":"This McDonalds is filthy! I'm amazed it can actually remain open!! From the minute you walk in to the the counters, bathrooms and seating area! The kids play land is horribly dirty.......so gross!"}
{"text":"It is what it is, a McDonalds.  You get what you expect.  Inexpensive fast food.  They do have a value menu.  I do like the fries.  The do have a double lane for the drive-thou.  entrance can be confusing."}
{"text":"Can I give zero stars? Dear McDonalds, how long do you let your fries incubate under the heat lamp before realizing that they've gone bad? The sad excuse for fries you gave me today tasted older than my grandmas umbilical cord. The box they came in would have tasted fresher. This location is getting worse and worse every time I go, which is becoming less and less frequent because of shenanigans like this. \n\nUpdate 2.2.16 \n\nI forgot that a large, well done fry meant a small, cold as ice, soggy fry. Once again, your below average mediocrity amazes me, McDonalds. I want to like you. In fact, I do like McDonalds. But this location is awful."}
{"text":"I'm shock by the reviews.. My first time here girl was very nice and friendly. Me and my husband stop by to get a bit. And they even brought our food to the table.. Maybe there a working progress but I know we got good service."}
{"text":"The last three times I've had food from this place I've had to return it. The manager was helpful, but if every time I come there I have to return the food because they incorrectly made the order I'll quit coming. The first two times was because they didn't make the order correct. This last time, I went through the drive through and ordered the buttermilk chicken sandwich. When I got home to eat with my family, I opened the sandwich to find that they have me dried up children that was cold and not only that, the chicken was in the pieces like it was meant for the chicken wrap or some sort of salad. The manager did replace and apologize for the sandwich but honestly it shouldn't have happened in the first place. By the time I got back home, the fries I had from the first trip was stone cold. It's a shame that I spent nearly twenty dollars for my our meal and the food is basically leftovers that I would feed my dog."}
{"text":"Cooperate office needs to see this.this location needs help. We are locals and it doesn't matter what time of day You try to get something to eat or drink here it always takes forever and the fries are always cold or too salty. If you go through the drive through it takes 20 mins or more you are stuck in line due to Barriers."}
{"text":"Lazy. Rude. Inefficient. Toyless kids meals... I could go on but I will just cut to the chase and say DO NOT GO HERE. Unless you want to deal with people that hate their jobs.. McDonald's is suppose to be bad, right?"}
{"text":"Great service at the drive-thru.  Could be a bit cleaner on the inside."}
{"text":"I have been in this drive thru line for the last 20 minutes. It is a Saturday night and there should be more help. I haven't even ordered.  Note to self, doing come to this Mc Donald's if your thirsty out hungry.  Not happy.. So I still sit here. . This is just ridiculous. I will not ever come here again."}
{"text":"Damn this mc Donald sucks. Everytime I come it's freaking slow. Busy or not the service is so slow. If I can give it negative star I would.its the convenient that's why I come here. They need to speed up."}
{"text":"I had a chicken sandwich Saturday night 3/2//13 at about 10:40pm and I was super sick all night and the past 2 days! Please do not eat at this location."}
{"text":"LAZY LAZY LAZY EMPLOYEES, doesn't matter what time I come thru the drive thru to eat, it's your job to provide service. Simply said that the system is down it will be 30-40 mins when I clearly saw you ring someone else up"}
{"text":"This place is not very consistent.  They change the hours of the ice cream machine all the time so $1 sundaes are a 50/50 shot.  If you order fries in the drive thru, it could take up to 5 minutes if they ran out.  They always look busy.  I don't think they are that busy, just unprepared and going by their own standards.   I'll skip this one as much as I can from now on."}
{"text":"Why is it when your Order is wrong they Act surprised like this has never happen before. Do yourself a walk in."}
{"text":"Worst McDonald in las vegas.  Can't get my order right when I repeated myself 4 times.   Then when I get my food that I asked for with no onions.  The only think on the burger was onions. No customer service.  No apologies.  Just unacceptable. I would advise anyone to eat taco bell instead ."}
{"text":"I dont even think it deserved a star in the first place. Went just seconds ago and while i was ordering the girl was making jokes and laughing, i had to leave and go to taco bell.. Right next to this awful mcdonalds. She didnt even care when i asked her to take my order. She just ignored me the whole time. \n\nWhat a shitty customer service"}
{"text":"I know... It's horrible that I feed my child these greasy, non-nutritional meals but you know what, there are days that I'm desperate. Call me a bad mom... Go ahead, I dare you! \n\nAnyway, sometimes it needs to be done. In any case, I don't have any problems whenever I come to this one. I go through the drive-thru, pay, pick up my order and roll out. My stuff is always in the bag and I've got a happy kid."}
{"text":"They only accept cash? Since when? Food was cold. Its Mc Donald's I guess that's expected? Oh and the cashier can't count. She short changed me. I think I'll call corporate. Worst Mc Donald's ever."}
{"text":"Worst attitudes. Gets orders wrong. Simple orders too. Like I want a large Coke. NAHHH BRUH you get a diet cherry Coke. \n\nBruh."}
{"text":"This is a low for Mickie d's my hamburger looked like it sat all day dry as the bun and meat, milkshake not even stirred  all the chocolate at bottom. It gets worse every time I go. For the money  I rather go to BK,s better and fresh not dry .If all Mc Donalds are this way no wonder they are falling."}
{"text":"This place is always cash only! Every time i come here... Cash only... \"We are cash only\"... Give me a break! Every where else you can pay debit/credit... Dont tell me it is because you are switching out your drawer... Its a credit card!!!!!!! I swear EVERY time i go here its CASH only!!!! Thats some shady business right there!! I keep going to burger king across the street no problem.... Come on guys!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, They ALWAYS take 10+ mins on ANY order. Today I got 2 large ice coffees and I waited exactly 17 mins for it. Not to mention I was at the order board and wait 5 mins and a car pulled up beside me and they took his order first and then told me to wait EVEN LONGER. This isn't just a 1 time thing, This happens every time."}
{"text":"Paige is an awesome employee! She is able to multi-task always with a smile! How refreshing for fast food!"}
{"text":"i visit this Mickee Dees if I'm in the Walmart, however every time I go here I keep saying to myself that I'll get in my car and go elsewhere. \nThe reason.....the staff. The cashiers are not friendly...they stand there and wait for you to order...no greeting..no \"can I take your order\"...nada. \nOn my last visit they were particularly surly...I get we all have bad days, but as a patron, I shouldn't be made to feel as though I was the cause of your latest break-up.\nAs this particular store is inside a Walmart, seating can be an issue as it's very small.\nFood is ok as far as fast food is concerned. It's McDonald's...you know what you're getting."}
{"text":"had high hopes trying this new McDonald's location. Supposed to have new high-tech ordering features, but was I disappointed. Starting from the counter where you order we waited 7 minutes for someone to realize there were four people in line waiting to take order. Then we couldn't find a table that wasn't sticky or dirty or have napkins and other peoples garbage on it. When we do sit down and begin eating we hear the overhead music that's playing in the restaurant is some type of\n ghetto rap, with lyrics that say sitting alone at home on the bathroom floor hungry have to have sex with a man for a little bit of money! Somehow I don't think that is a Ronald McDonald theme song, just my thought as for the food hamburgers had very little amount of condiments hardly any ketchup onions they were almost there, the Italian tasty that they were selling the chicken was dry and dark and hard I would not order it again"}
{"text":"What is up their butts at this Mcdonalds?!\nThe staff is always so grumpy.\nLocated inside the cr*ppy Walmart is a cr*ppy Mcdonalds, but again close to work.\nI have never had a problem with their food, I just find their staff is always unhappy!\nFood and McCafe beverages have always been good at this location, Front counter staff has always been unfriendly.\nCheer up!"}
{"text":"people actually review McDees? whats there to rate... its MacDonalds......so since im here...the poutine sucks and the big Mac...well it tastes like a big Mac..what did you expect?\nWhy do you alsways have to ask for ketchup? Is this where they make their billions?"}
{"text":"Je d√©teste ce McDonald! A chaque que j'y vais le service est plus que d√©plorable, il est lamentable! Les employ√©s ont l'air √©nerv√©s et parlent presque mal aux clients et quand on a le malheur de leur poser une question (¬´ Quelles sauces il y a avec les croquettes de poulet? ¬ª) on est √† deux doigts de se faire mordre!!!! Et je ne parle pas seulement d'une fois ou deux, non je dis bien A CHAQUE FOIS! \nS√ªrement le pire McDonald du monde en termes d'ambiance!"}
{"text":"Typical McDonalds - they're confused as hell when you ask for plain eggs. Small, slow and dirty. 20 minutes later and still no scrambled eggs. They come pre-mixed in a container. They're literally to stupid to know how to do that. Actual experiece."}
{"text":"There are a lot of homeless people, but I don't mind... I'm actually inspired by the owners kindness. It gets really cold in Montreal. Anyways...\n\nThe food is McDonald's... that's what it is. Service can at times be downright bad though... I remember one time I went in and I could not understand the girl behind the counter... I figured that she could not understand English and so switched to French... she couldn't understand that either so we got into a menu pointing game...\n\nBut other than that .. again it's Mc'donalds.. the food taste... like all the other ones."}

N√©anmoins, tous les avis sur les commerces sont bons, non?!\nC√¥t√© nourriture, c'est gras, c'est lourd √† dig√©rer, c'est sucr√©. Quand j'accompagne quelqu'un y aller, ce que je vais prendre c'est un caf√© et dans un cas de grande faim, je vais prendre un muffin (fruit&fibre).

Les gens n'ont pas l'air √©panoui du tout. En m√™me temps, que voulez-vous c'est un fast-food et qui dit fast-food dit service rapide. Ce n'est donc pas l√† qu'on va pouvoir d√©battre avec un serveur, en quelque sorte. Donc si vous r√©ussissez √† obtenir le sourire d'un employ√© au guichet de commande est bien ce ne sera que bref.

{"text":"Ahhh...The smell of urine as you walk through the front door to get your morning cup of coffee from this Macca (McD's) is what wakes you up first - not the coffee!\n\nIt's prone to homeless people with always having a pan handler outside asking for change. \n\nI tend to make this my breakfast stop - so the staff here tend to be quick and very friendly. Rarely do they mix up orders.\n\nThe new line of coffees from the McCafe are great. Love the Mocca."}
{"text":"The service are always slow, and sometimes rude (well it's McDonald's, but I've seen better). The only thing that bothers me is that they cannot execute an order without any flaws, I asked for extra onions and bacon and no pickles for my burger, and paid the extra costs, however all I got was one slice of bacon and... bunch of pickles.\n\nI've come to this place too much, and recently I've discovered another McDonald's in Eaton Centre, I'd suggest that place over here because I cannot see how can it get worse than this."}
{"text":"It's the closest Mickey D's to where I am. Sadly, it's like most American McDonalds locations...bums at the door who hope that by them holding the door open for you, you will give them spare change and mostly colored folk working the cash registers. It's more expensive than in the States, as most things seem to be here in Canada. What it costs me for a hamburger, fries, and a soda in the U.S is almost a full dollar or more here. It gets crowded at night and there are of course the local kids who come in to order food and or just use the bathroom. The ketchup dispenser isn't always full."}
{"text":"Arrived at 3:55 am and ordered our stuff. Debit card wasn't accepted so went off looking for an ATM. Arrived back at 4:05 am only to hear that they suddenly changed available menus to 'breakfast only'. Personnel couldn't do anything without manager. Instead, he recommended us a place nearby that was able to sell us hamburgers. A McDonalds that can't sell hamburgers to customers? Unheard of. Not visiting ever again."}
{"text":"I understand it is not a fine dinning restaurant but when I get bad customer service from the manager herself, that's terrible. She was wearing a different uniform, she is May be the team leader or the manager. I went there in the morning just to get some coffee. She was behind the cash, busy texting on her phone while taking my order and she had me repeat what I want because clearly she was not paying attention. I found that a bit too much. One more thing, every other staff I saw there was wearing a hair net except for her which is not hygienic. I would never order food at that location."}
{"text":"It's a McD's that's open (I believe) 24 hours... that should be all the review you need to know what to expect.  \n\nThere's always a few homeless hanging around the door, as well as a bunch more that will sleep at tables inside during the later hours.\n\nThe only time I've gone here was late night, for a mid-drinking pit stop.  Which is all McDonald's food is really good for, in my opinion.  Laying down a base for the booze.\n\nThe staff is about average for a McD's... which is to say, less then agreeable.  But in the 90 seconds it takes to spit out, \"Medium Big Mac meal, Sprite no ice.\"  Who really cares about customer service?  They're probably making less then decent money, working crap hours and dealing with every form of pain-in-the-ass under the sun.  They get a pass if they're a bit grumpy.\n\nOne night after getting our food and sitting down, me and my friends were joined by a uninvited girl that was clearly tweaking on something.  But she wasn't doing anything but telling us stories about how the government abducted here and implanted a tracking chip in her head.  To 3 drunks that were there just to shovel greasy burgers down our throats, she was more then welcome entertainment.\n\nBut that gives you the idea of the type of atmosphere you'll find in the late night hours in this joint."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with friends. It was really busy around 1:20 pm - the line went out the door despite all cashes being open. \n\nThis location is renovated and has a mccafe. \n\nThe sweet chilli chicken wrap was barely palatable... It had enough mayonnaise and sweet chilli sauce to drown a small puppy in. Not sure if this is how all establishments do it or if they were just heavy handed here."}
{"text":"First let me express that I am by no means a McDonald's regular. However, having lived in Tokyo and Madrid for the past 10 years and just recently returning to Canada, I had the urge to see if McDonalds in Canada tasted as good as I remembered (relatively speaking that is). I have been here 1.5 months and just ventured there today, so by no means was it at the top of my priority list. In fact, the coupons that came in the mail, that expire tomorrow, played into my visit (yup I am a fool for a good coupon!). \n\nOn the positive, the actual hamburgers were much fresher than I've experienced living abroad, so yes the burgers were much better and fries were of the normal quality (not too salty actually). So why the 2 stars you say? \n\nWe ordered 2 large size sets (on another note, my god they are big!) and they gave us a small fries with large drinks... not a huge deal, but just the principle that if you pay extra for something you should get what you pay for. Secondly, the Coke ZERO was horrific. I am pretty sure they syrup was almost out and it just tasted like carbonated water... Being a Saturday afternoon and a line 20 deep, it just wasn't worth it to complain or get them to change the order... it's McDonald's afterall :)\n\nDefinitely won't return on a weekend as they simply looked overwhelmed... may venture back once in a blue moon during a non-peak period, but can't see."}
{"text":"This one is okay. Very annoying when people backup waiting for the drive thru\n\nIt gets busy and for the most part clean. On a scale of ghetto..it's 3/5."}
{"text":"I love McDonalds. I am a regular at this location. The parking lot here is small, and so is the inside, but it is the new McCafe design.\n\nYou cannot beat their $1 summer drinks. Especially love their iced coffees. \n\nAlso, the new summer fiesta wrap is amazing.  There food is actually better than most of the food in North York.  McDonalds also gives out coupons in the mail. If you don't want them you can give them to me LOL."}
{"text":"McDonalds has improved its decor and menu over the years and I have visited this location a few times. Lines are fast and service is friendly. Very organized.\n\nI recommend downloading the My McD's app on your phone as you get promotions and coupons directly to your phone instead of carrying paper coupons around with you."}
{"text":"Service was slow, but they gave extra minion toys, even though they weren't the ones I wanted."}
{"text":"This McDonald's doesn't even deserve 1 star. The manager is the worse. I came in about 5 times since its the most convenient one and everytime I went they got my order wrong."}
{"text":"This restaurant doesn't deserve a star at all.This is the second McD's restaurant that I get horrible food. Check out my picture of my chicken sandwich not good. My wife had a bit of it and it taste horrible like it was sitting there for hours. Check out the lettuce that says it all. Very disappointed I guess I might be done with this McD's also or the Restaurants period."}
{"text":"We have gone to this Mcdonalds on a fairly regular basis for years, I love fairly close, drive by it all the time, and it's easy to get in and out of.  Food is typical Mcdonalds food.  If I wanted to go to Mcdonalds and I was in the area, would definitely choose this one."}
{"text":"This review is with a heavy heart as it would be my first extremely negative review.  \n\nWhile sitting at the drive though I could hear music playing on the other end as the person on the other side was attempting to take my order.  I pulled up to the first window and the music is still blasting off the individuals phone.  I could also hear a lot of \"rowdy\" noise from behind the window as his co-workers were singing and play around with each other.  I paid and proceeded to the next window.  The worker started to hand me the drinks.  As he passed over one of the drinks the lid was filled with overflow soda and as he handed it to me tips the cup so it spills all over my shirt sleeve.  He looked right at me then turned and walked away.  I requested some napkins to clean up the spill. This seemed to put him off and he tossed me a couple of napkins with no apology nor eye contact.  We received our order. I Iooked in the bag, there was no straws, napkins nor sauce for the chicken nuggets.  I asked to speak with the manager.  Some young 18-19 year old man came to the window with an attitude and said \"what do you want?\"  I walked him though my experience and he said, \" there is nothing i can do.\"  I asked for his managers number.  He said he is the General Manager and that he can't give me the owners name or any other number to call.  I said this is unacceptable and I needed someone to address the spilled soda and the pure lack of customer service.  He said i could call his HR department and that he would have to take the food back and give me a refund before he would provide me with the number ...  Really!!!  I said no, I am keeping the food with three hungry kids in the back.  He then said, \"we make enough money that losing you as a customer is ok with me.\" WOW!\n\nI drove away and vow to never ever return to this McDonald's and maybe the entire brand!  This will bum my kids out but In and Out is closer to our house and they know how to treat a person.  Just because it is fast food does not mean that the service can treat customer this way.  To the owner, who makes enough money, maybe this be the wake up call you need to inspect your business and who is representing you! ...  My guess is the culture of this franchise is a direct reflection of the owner.  Culver's, In and Out, Wendy's, Jack in the Box, Burger King ...  Here we come!"}
{"text":"I worked in fast food for 10 years and no matter how bad of a day I was having I never took it out on my customers. It wasn't their fault I didn't like my job and it wasn't their fault that I had that job in the first place therefore there was no reason for me to treat them poorly, but this place no matter what time of day I go, no matter what Time of year I go no matter who was taking my order or handing the order to me they are constantly rude it is almost as if I'm dealing with a robot.\n\nI am 42 years old and I have never ever seen customer service as bad as this place.\n\nI will never ever go to this McDonald's again and every chance I get I will tell everyone I meet in this neighborhood how bad it is until something changes.\n\nHey McDonald's this is hands down your worst restaurant in America.\n\nI refuse to give it a star, but I have no choic"}
{"text":"I only swing in McDonalds on my way into the office and I always use the drive-thru. The service is friendly and quick, and my order is always correct (sugar free vanilla iced coffee). \n\nSometimes there are issues with the clarity in speakers in the drive thru but I will say the menu is hung at a perfect height to have good visibility of all options."}
{"text":"Fast food so average rating but they did get my order completely perfect! Was happy with my order. However,   It was my fault but when I ordered a sausage mcgriddle I was hoping it was going to have an egg and cheese not just a sausage and bun. It was disappointing and wished they would have explained but next time I'll know."}
{"text":"Third time here and the staff is always rude and something is always wrong. I will no longer give my money to this business. How hard is it to pretend to be in a good mood. Get this staff together."}
{"text":"Came to this location after an orthodontist appointment, wanting a Shamrock Shake since my mouth was sore after getting my braces adjusted. Got in and out quickly and the shake was so good and tasty!\n\nThis location is okay, but since I don't live in this neighborhood anymore, I don't come to this location very often anymore."}
{"text":"This place needs new management or something. It's filthy and they were out of straws and ketchup at NOON.  Hello pretty sure that is a lunch rush time.  I accidentally spilled my ice coffee when I went to grab my tray off the counter. The spill sat there for SEVERAL minutes before someone came to finally clean it up."}
{"text":"20 minute wait for food (to be fair, the cashier did apologize for the wait), and the presentation was awful. I RARELY visit McDonalds, however when I do, I just opt for the filet-o-fish. I asked for extra tartar sauce; when I got home and opened it up, tartar sauce was EVERYWHERE! It seemed as if it was done on purpose by a disgruntled angst-filled teen. I don't expect top notch service from fast-food restaurants, however this was downright awful. I had no business eating that garbage anyway. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"I entered  this establishment in expecting the convenience of cheap (& crapy) fast food and nothing more and left with with a new attitude. Avery made sure that my order was not only on point, but that I was content as a customer before leaving. When I complained about the taste of the coffee, he  replaced it without any hesitation. I only wish that all businesses could run this smoothly."}
{"text":"Working in the area, I have been here many times over the last 6 yrs and it has been getting worse and worse over the last couple yrs. I don't know if it's new management,  staff turnover, or what. They are always rude, the orders are almost NEVER right.l and if you take it back to get it done correctly, they get snoody and try to argue about it. Wanting fresh frues, you better forget about it! They don't even know the kinds of dipping sauced they have. They always try to tell me they don't have certain kinds that I know they have. I really wish there were another one closer, so I don't have to waste my money here and have to order 3 times before it is correct."}
{"text":"This is the worst McDonald's ever! I've never gone here without ordering something that they were out of. Tonight I went there and I wanted ice cream. Out of ice cream. So okay I'll have 2 apple pies, if you have that. The lady replied yes we have that. Pulled up to the window. And the lady told me they only have one apple pie. Thanks."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru to order my meal. I ordered a sausage egg McMuffin and a sausage McGriddle. they never once repeated their order like they said they did. not at the window not at the drive thru part. I went all the way home i sat down in my chair opened up the sausage McMuffin and it was a ham mcmuffin. I was like okay I'll go back there and just get it replaced it's no big deal. so I get back there and ask them to replace my meal and they start talking to each other.  one of the managers asked the other managers did you repeat the order at both windows and she said yes but she didnt. Then they start saying that I was wrong and that she repeated it at the windows so it was my fault. That's when I started to get angry because the whole part of that job is customer service. And she wasn't treating me like I was some stupid fool who was wrong. That's when I asked for my money back and the food because that is unacceptable behavior to be acting towards a customer. Then when I tried to get her name to report hwr she wouldn't give it to me stating that I had no right to ask her for her name. So I tried to ask the other lady but she wouldn't give it to me. I finally found an employee to give her name to me. Her name was Maria and she was the only manager there at that time so it's not like I could do much else. SO I got my money and left l. Also they full meal was $7.00. And she only gave me back 6.14 because I left the drink at home."}
{"text":"This place SUCKS! Now, I never thought I'd rate a fast food restaurant, but when it blows this badly, I had to tell someone.\n\nContinuously soggy fries, screwed up orders in the drive through, filling the cup to 80% full, little petty things I know but when your in a hurry it can really screw with your day. \n\nI will continue to eat there since it is the closest to my house, and I'm sure this won't be my last rant about it, but be warned, YOUR lunch hour can be ruined too by this place. /rant"}
{"text":"I rarely ever go to McDonalds but on this particular morning I decided to go to the drive threw where I encountered the rudest employees working the window, they were not helpful, polite, or patient those bitches need to get fired because they obviously don't have customer service skills I will never return to this ghetto ass McDonalds ever again"}
{"text":"Just needed a quick fix yesterday night. I believe it was the manager that took my order as she seemed very striaght forward and I really appreciate that. Spoke a little too fast but ether way I ended up waiting 7 mins for my food... and about 5 miles out found that I was missing a cheeseburger... Tried calling but nothing. I didn't bother going back I believe this will be the last time I go back to any Mcdonalds again.\n\nBtw some of my nuggets were already cold and some of the fries soggy. But the big mac and the fish filled were alright."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible! Every time I go through the drive thru it's always something bad. And with all the bad attitudes I've experienced here this one just had to take the cake. I went thru with my bf and my friend. And they heard me say my order not once but THREE TIMES. I ordered a meal for my bf and a large drink for my friend. Very simple. First window of course same old girl who always snuffs me and gives her attitude when I give her my money. After I get my receipt I check it and say she forgot to add the large drink. And so the next window I explained to the lady about my drink and this Mexican lady told me she couldn't do my transaction because she had no money in her register. I looked at her like seriously..? So I said um ok well I can pay with my credit card no big deal. She refused that payment as well before handing me my bfs order. To me that's just so confusing on why you would turn away a customer for no reason like that..."}
{"text":"An order of the 10 piece chicken nugget meal, with two extra 10 piece boxes. Simple order right? They tried giving me a Big Mac at the window. When I corrected them on my order, took almost 10 minutes to get the food. I was in such a hurry, I forgot to check the bag before I left. No fries, three sauces (and not the kind I asked for). Three sauces for 30 nuggets? Seriously? And these people want $15/hr? Get the order right and you might be worth what they're currently paying you!"}
{"text":"It's so annoying how if you go late at night when your hungry as hell their \"machine\" for taking credit of debit is not working and I don't know about you guys but I never carry cash so it sucks to have to drive to another McDonald's. It happens all the time, this one is the closest to my house."}
{"text":"The girl that took my order wasn't paying attention and I had to repeat myself 3 times while she giggled to someone in the background. When I got home there was no sauce for my nuggets! And the soda I ordered was diet instead of regular.. I have a really bad artificial sweetener allergy. This is why the McDonald's franchise is going down hill. And these people want a raise lol?"}
{"text":"There was 3 cars ahead of me and I have not been waiting in the Drive-Thru for 45 minutes. They really need to get their s*** together especially if they want to be open 24 hours"}
{"text":"This Mcdonalds is where you want to come if u have small children & eat  at the Golden Arches. The place is done in animal print & has an extensive indoor playroom that looks fun for children to tire themselves out in."}
{"text":"Ok i understand the management is pregnant. No one ever cleans this place, seen full cups of soda just left out all over the floor. Kids go here. Seen so much uncleanness in the restrooms. They put on shiw for ska so i wanba support them but just clean this place up. And don't argue if the order is wrong."}
{"text":"I like this McDonalds because of the owner's African decor.  It's very unique.  The service is about like the others, but the artwork and statues were certainly different."}
{"text":"Actually a good experience. Order was right, temp in the building was good, employees funny, and friendly.\n It's done in a jungle theme, I didn't visit the rest room but my Mom did and said it was beautiful. LOL Ok, Mom... \n Monopoly is back, won a breakfast sandwich but McMuffins are NOT included? WTF?\n Parking good, service fast, play place clean. Good place."}
{"text":"This place was so disgusting! First I walked in and immediately wrinkled my nose because it smells like stinky feet. I took my kid here to kill time and play in the play area. Obviously it never gets cleaned or deodorized because it was unbearable to sit in the play area. Mostly because of the smell which worked it's way to the entire store. I asked the cashier if they had a deodorizer and she just laughed. I ordered my food, it was pretty dead in there and it took about 15 min to get a kids meal. Couldn't find a clean table they were all pretty disgusting. The floor looked like it hadn't been swept or mopped in days. Trash and spilled drinks everywhere. The condiments were not filled and there were no napkins. I had to clean a table and asked the cashier for some napkins to do so and she handed me 3 napkins.. Go anywhere to eat but here. If the front of the house is that disgusting I don't even want to know what it looks like in the back where they're cooking food!"}
{"text":"Experience:  my nephews were in town, 8 and 4, and they were cooped up in the house during the cold weather. I looked up online to find a close McDonalds with a playground and this came up. We arrived around 6:30 at night. \n\nFacility:  this is one of the best parts about this McDonald's.  It was obviously recently built or remodeled. It also had a safari theme, so the decor was cooler than any other McDonald's I've seen. The playground area kept the kids interest the whole time. There were lots of bronze statues of animals in and outside of the restaurant. \n\nService:  rarely are the servers at McDonald's nice, but these folks were friendly and brought the food to us back in the playground area. \n\nFood:  fries were hot and fresh!  Yes!!!!!\n\nOverall:  for a fast food spot, this place was top notch. I will be back, especially if I have any kids in tow."}
{"text":"I ordered two double cheeseburgers. When I got home, I found that the burger had no cheese, nor onions, ketchup, or pickles. Confused, I looked back at the receipt and it said two double cheeseburgers with no specifications and they charged me full price! Never going here again."}
{"text":"Worst drive through ever. It's 1:30 in the morning and it took 25 minutes to get 2 cheeseburgers. I'd pass this as a late night option and just drive your drunk ass home"}
{"text":"I can't believe no one has mentioned the African decor in this McDonald's.  It's different and wacky and I kind of love it.  Star!\n\nStopped here because Boy needed to use bathroom right away.  Bathroom clean.  Star!\n\nManager kind of reminds me of my nephew. Star!\n\nBoy wanted Cookies 'n Cream ice cream.  Ordered McFlurry with Oreos.  Star!\n\nBoy having fun in Playland.  Star!\n\nDude sleeping in corner with head on table.  Negative star.\n\nOther than that, it's McDonald's, so what do you expect?\n\nI haven't eaten at a McDonald's in a long time, so I was kind of surprised how hard it is to read the menu.  What with all the new menu options and having to show calories and pictures, there is too much info to fit on the board.  I felt like I needed to sit down with a paper menu to take it all in."}
{"text":"Hubby and I get breakfast here on Sundays, not every Sunday but quite a few. Been doing this for 8 years. Before all day breakfast - food fresh and hot. Always awesome hash browns, HOT hot cakes. Very good. After all day breakfast. Let's just say that we will be changing our McD's. Hash browns are limp - like bend and not break and taste like oil. Hot cakes are luke  warm. Not very appetizing. Don't know what is going on - perhaps cooking ahead of time and nuking - just know that I am now being disappointed every time I go here now. Let's pick it up guys. Clean the place,  cook food when ordered or at least a REASONABLE amount of food so that everything isn't, um, not so awful. You can do better."}
{"text":"20 minute (literally) drive thru wait at 12:30 on a Thursday.. Won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"I needed to male a quick stop for a drink before going to a show late last night.  I stopped here, and it was quick and easy.  i was in an out in no time at all.\n\nVery efficient staff.  It was 11:15 PM, so there weren't many customers.  Still service was great!"}
{"text":"Waiting 10 minutes, still haven't gotten my order, I thought this was supposed to be fast food?"}
{"text":"I wish there was a negative number because they don't even deserve a single star I was going in for ice had a hot bottle of water it was a 110 degree weather the manager made a messed up comment the girl at the register said I have to pay for ice and in a very rude tone and wile walking out I herd a snide comment from the manager it was racist and I will never forget it and all my friends family anyone else don't eat McDonald's Jack in the box or Wendy's are way better for you anyways \nThe kids play area is dangerous big door kids can slam hands in it"}
{"text":"Been waiting in line for 20 minutes now. These guys are always very slow after 9pm but today was the worst!!!"}
{"text":"It's OK for fast food. Service was fairly quick but order was wrong. Restaurant was packed full and drive thru had line back up on Sahara."}

Takes literally 15-20 minutes to get to my window ..

And drove away with my food\n\nTried uploading my receipt showing I paid at 2;01 and left at 2:09 after I ordered 20 minutes before"}
{"text":"Again, I don't think I could give any chain place a 5, but this was a good McDonalds. I'm beginning to think Yelp ratings are useless for chains like this, because we were ALMOST scared away by the 2.5. But a McDonalds is a McDonalds, how bad could it be?\n\nWell, we were very pleasantly surprised. Everyone was super friendly (like legitimately nice people friendly), and our order was correct and really good. Sometimes you get a dry burger, or old fries...everything was hot, fresh, and delicious. It really hit the spot, and we at least learned the lesson that there's no point looking at Yelp reviews for McDonalds. Ironic that I'm now writing one :p"}
{"text":"Used the drive thru this morning and the service was crap...the girl taking orders was trying to rush through our order and wouldn't stop talking over us, making us repeat our order like 10 times!  What made it worse was, from the very beginning, after every item, she would ask, \"will that complete your order?\"  VERY annoying!  Then, when we get our food she tells us to check to make sure she got everything, which we do anyways, but when we opened the bag, everything was thrown in the bag...hash browns out of their little packages, the breakfast sandwiches were coming out of the wrapper and they forgot a breakfast burrito!  NEVER coming back to this location!  Complained to the manager about this, as well!"}
{"text":"Hmmm\nNew thought. \nCan a fast food place get five stars?\nIt's not like I was expecting gourmet food. \nI was hoping for the best mc'ds has to offer. \nI mean isn't that what fast food is all About?\nGetting exactly what the franchise wants you to get so you are happy.\n\nI am happy. \n\nAlthough there was a small language barrier for me. We communicated.\nMy wife And I received exactly what we desired. \nA fresh, hot, neatly put together, bfast sandwich. \nThe hash brown was slightly more oily than I think corporate might like but it was a solid b+\n\nSo yes. \nFast food restaurants deserve 5 stars if you get what is marketed, and expected. \n( usually you don't)\n\nWhy can't they all be like this. \n\n\nPs. \nOwner keeps the bathroom key under control. Nicest , cleanest, classiest customer bathroom I've EVER seen in a f food establishment. \n\nGreat animal metal castings adorn the grounds, put your kid on a mini elephant.  \n\nGreat seat decorations. Not the typical yellow and orange designed to get you to leave.  \n\nGood job franchisee, \nIf I lived nearby id patronize ff more often, not just when I'm in a rush or on va-ca."}
{"text":"yuck.......Is it me or has McDonalds food gotten smaller & grosser?\nI saw they had the McRib making a limited time comeback so I was feeling all nostalgic and thought I'd give it a go.\n\nBig mistake..worse than any school lunch pork patty-by the 3rd bite I was already nauseous. How does McDonalds stay open the food is sooo terrible and its not even cheap anymore.\n\nDo quality food establishment have to have a drive-thru because people have gotten so lazy they will eat any damn thing as long as they don't have to get off their asses to do it."}
{"text":"Love me some mcgriddles. The drive thru was fast and efficient. And it's a great location to people watch. For example I one got to watch a crazy lady yell into a cardboard box whilst I was waiting for my turn at the drive thru"}
{"text":"This McDonalds is horrible to the max. I happen to be nearby and my friends wanted to get some latte so we did a drive thru to order.\n\nThere were so many cars but the line was going faster than I expected so I got to order a lot sooner. We ordered a vanilla latte and a McFlurry. It's not so hard to miss my order, yes?\n\nWe paid and drove off and I gave my friend her vanilla latte and it was a regular latte! She waa craving vanilla latte so bad and that's why we stopped by McDonalds to get it because she wanted one from here!!\n\nI couldnt go back because traffic was bad and I felt lazy to go back and complain but I still dont understand why and how they messed up my order. In fact, I didnt even get a receipt! From the first window where I paid, I asked if I am getting a receipt and he told me in the next window when I get my food but they only handed me a latte and a McFlurry.\n\nNever coming back to this location in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came thru the drive thru just for 2 drinks.. Currently still waiting in line and ordered the 2 drinks at 6:38pm. Time is now 6:52 and there's still 2 cars in front of me. Bad bad service not the first time that this happens either.."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would. I went there this morning through the drive thru and ordered food for my family along with oatmeal for my 10 month old son. I got home sat down to feed it to him and there was a piece of plastic in the oatmeal!!!\n\nI called to complain and no one could understand me and kept handing the phone to different ppl with no resolution. Not even caring if my son would have choked.....wow!!!!"}
{"text":"Rude, 20 minutes time limit, security kicks you out without letting you finish your meal, even with 70% seats empty. Stay away if you want a peaceful meal."}
{"text":"One of them new fancy mccafe/ mcdonalds hybrids. This location had a lot of teething problems when it first opened but seems to have sorted them out. Service is fairly quick and there is always lots of seating upstairs plus WiFi.  Not the worst mcdonalds location by any stretch."}
{"text":"Best McDonalds I've ever been to. It's the new hybrid of fast food/Starbucks McCafe thing and the portion sizes are smaller, less expensive, and great places to sit and watch the action unfold on Yonge Street a block north of Dundas Square. Upstairs level as well. They're trying to attract local University students and gadget lovers, so there's an outlet at every seat to plug in and charge your device. Other customers were cool (keep in mind it's only been open one day) but, unlike other local McDonald's I witnessed nobody drunk, high, bleeding, screaming, crying, vomiting, hallucinating, etc. I'll definitely be back as I'm a big fan of fast food as long as the portions are smaller and I'm not spending ten bucks on a hamburger and a diet coke."}
{"text":"Jeffrey who used to be a manager was and still is a pedophile and racist. I used to be a regular customer who'd hear his rude comments every time I'd come in. He's disgusting"}
{"text":"Food was terrible $5 for Artisan Grilled chicken sandwich. The lettuce wilted the chicken was rubbery the sauce was runny the bun was dense the food was cold. I have not been to Mc D's in long time. Thought I would give them a try. No way even again. What crap they serve you. Rip off big time. Ordered at drive thru found out how bad it was when got home.. I am in the restroom now it made me sick. No more ever ever again Mc D's... Going to stay with firehouse sub's.  Please people do not eat her or any Mc D's the food is all crap. Go to Firehouse Sub instead"}
{"text":"They didn't even post at the drive thru that there was no ice cream, again. So go stuck in the drive thru line for ten minutes and only two cars where I front of me. They aren't friendly here."}
{"text":"I was trying to quickly get my mother something after the longest move of all time.. I was behind ONE family due to .. lack of a brain.. anyway the lady behind the counter was so sweet and dealt with all the families non sense and gave me my order for free for all the time I waited and the madness that occurred before me.. she was great.. this actually happened a long time ago, about 7-8 months ago at about 12o clock or so..I started this review and forgot to finish but the girl was so sweet I couldn't not finish the review"}
{"text":"Food is good for a mc Donald's.  I didn't get what I ordered but survived none the less.  Ordered a cheese burger and ended up with a double cheese burger.  \n\nDidn't like the staff behind the cashier using derogatory terms about whoever they were talking about.  I know it wasn't me as the term they were using is generally not reserved for white females.  Really unprofessional. \n\nLocation is great. On the southwest side of the street on Spring Mountain and Durango.  It's attached to a gas station so you can multi-task!\n\nLots of parking and parking for your bike too!"}
{"text":"Pulled in. Said my order. The guy completely butchered it and treated me like I was a stupid idiot for ordering an iced latte! Screen showed wrong so I tried to correct him. No answer for a solid 4 min of sitting there. Then he rudely says are you going to pull up? From there... Didn't charge the right amount and was more concerned with talking about a party with this guy behind him. From there... I pull up (wrong order).... Ask for what I ordered and got the wrong thing again. Props to the girl at the second window apologizing and so on but still c'mon 1 freAking iced latte!!!"}
{"text":"These people want us to raise min wage to 15 an hour when they can't get a simple order right and then argue about it ? You can't even do the basic essentials of a simple task. You put in the order and give the customer what they paid for. Not argue with them. This is why they won't raise your pay because you can't do your job right. You get paid what you put in."}
{"text":"I watched this place as well as everything along durango by the park go up. i remember when it used to be a dirt lot. \n\nGreat location. SUPER convenient when need a fast and quick bite. Chevron is right there attached as well. \n\nOut of the many years its been open, i've only had 1 issue and it was so long ago, i dont remember what happened. I just remember they gave me more food as an apology.. Haha. \n\nDrive thru usually pretty fast."}
{"text":"This location is disgusting the entire lobby was completely trashed and they were dead(I have photo evidence) the employees clearly dont care especially because they saw me come in and still helped a guest who approached after I had already been standing there for five minutes. How this place has an A grading from the health department is beyond me. I will be taking my business down to the Buffalo location where they actually care."}
{"text":"They would not redeem my 2 monopoly free fries in the drive through.   I saved up 2 game pieces for free fries and also ordered burgers through the drive-through.  The guy taking the order would not give me 2 free fries and stated that I would need to come inside because he can't ring both.  A simple solution would be to ring two separate order for me and hand them to me through the window.  Now I know why some people get raged in the news over an order."}
{"text":"Best Mcdonalds i have EVER been to! and that says a lot considering ive lived all over the valley. The staff at this Mcdonalds IS customer service. never once have i had my meal incorrectly made, and the cashiers are always polite. The manager Yuryn during dayshift always handles the rush quixkly and efficiently, and the swing manager Emanuel is always (i think his name is) polite and efficient. Only downside to this place is the skate park across the street, it brings a lot of disrespectul teenagers but the staff always allows them to hang around so long as they don't dirty the place too badly. Overall a great place for a quick bite, just go thru the drive thru to avoid the skater boys :)"}
{"text":"They are getting better instead of everytime messing my order its almost everytime I go inside everytime now because if you go through the drive through theywil mess your order up....this lady a few days ago was so confident she got my order right she watched me go through my bag (like i did somethin wrong) and praised herself on gettin the order right but  YOU DIDNT!!! my onions were still wrong after \"ya ya i got this\" but you didnt cuz you were to busy with something else and not listening....I really believe everyone in this location severly puffs the ganga b4 work  cuz they can never get it! Not that i blame them BUT i still pay for it so GET IT TOGETHER!!!!"}
{"text":"Its McDonalds folks. It was early and I needed a quick bite and a sugar free vanilla iced coffee. I had a big breakfast w/out the hotcakes...it was so so, My coffee on the other hand was yummy! I ordered a small one and they ended up giving me a large one so that made up for the mediocre cold food. One thing I really hate with McDonalds is that they are so damn stingy with condiments and napkins. I mean really!? Needless to say I only stop here when its a last resort."}
{"text":"I have not eaten in a McDonalds in over ten years and now I remember why! Not only was the Big Mac cold and rubbery, but there was a mound of onions under each tasteless patty, little to no special sauce, and a huge handful of lettuce, even though I ordered it with NO lettuce! I am sure I will not be returning to fast food ever again!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. This location is absolutely horrendous! 20 minutes in a drive through?? Every single time I come to this location they mess something up. Whether it being them completely messing up my order, my food being cold, or the obnoxious wait times. If you can refrain from coming to this location then that's an excellent choice!"}
{"text":"Zero stars if possible. Asked for a peppermint mocha which is clearly pictured on their windows only to have them tell me they don't make them. I hear another worker tell the drive thru operator tell him that they do have them. When I pull up to the drive thru they ask me to park because they accidentally made a hot chocolate instead. I park and wait.. get my \"peppermint mocha\". I drive away and as I'm driving away I taste it and it's a regular mocha. Cmon Mc D's it's just a drink.. your better than this!!!"}
{"text":"Can you say slow drive thru, took dang near 20 minutes to order and get food.  They loose numerous customers who drive off because of this.  They need to learn meaning of fast food."}
{"text":"They must be slammed with customers all here for the McRib sandwiches at 2:30pm on a Tuesday, because order took noticeably longer than expected.  \n\nThe napkin dispenser was out of napkins before I arrived, and after picking up by din-in order and letting the manager know I needed napkins for the messy hands I am going to have to wipe eating 2 \"Saucy\". No ketchup packets and that ketchup dispense into those paper cup thing is not out either.\n\nSo the place looks rather messy for a McDonalds, especially during the day.  \n\nFood is served as expected. Not fancy. Not as good looking as it appeared in advertising. But still met the low expectation of childhood comfort food. Although I am way over the whole McNugget craving, since they switched to super-processed mechanically separated chicken meat a decade or two ago.\n\nAnyway, I came for the McRib. Ate two of them. And that craving will more than likely be well satisfied for at least another year. Next time I am back will be for the fries.\n\nMinus a star or two for this location for slumming it."}
{"text":"Heading home, I made a quick stop here to pick up a McFlurry for dessert.  Service was prompt, the restaurant was clean, and about the only thing to diminish my enjoyment of the McFlurry was the woman talking on her cell phone at about 120 decibels.  After a few strategic glares from me, she took it outside.\n\nI generally don't stop at thisMcDonald's, but given the circumstances and the fact I was heading home, it made a good place to get dessert!\n\nAnd, there's free wifi."}
{"text":"Service is fast and food is good BUT how come whenever I try to use Apple Pay it NEVER works at the drive thru. What's the point of introducing this technology and innovation and be complacent about fixing it or getting it to work. I've never had an issue at other McDonalds. It's either laziness on the owners part or ignorance. Staff is nice tho!"}
{"text":"I don't like giving bad reviews, but this is the WORST McDonalds EVER. This isn't a one time thing either, constant mistakes, wrong orders (and I'm not altering my order in any way)...seriously? How hard is it to just get it right?!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely go here for their timer promotion between 11-2, they always take awhile so you can definitely score a free sammich"}
{"text":"We live close to this location and the one on Buffalo so sometimes it is a flip of a coin which one to go to. \n\nThis location is an epic fail. \n\nEach time we go they mess the order up to the point of being ridiculous. \n\nI have ordered a hamburger pickle only and get a hamburger with ketchup only. Order on the screen is correct, tag on the burger is correct leading me to believe they either can't read or are too busy playing around to pay attention to the order they are prepping. \n\nToday I ordered two number ones repeated myself 3 times. The order taker told me my order was 5.00 umm that would be for one. We get the order corrected and I moved into the next window. That lady kept saying I ordered one number 2. She gave me 3 straws and when got home one of the egg mcmuffins wasn't even wrapped but it looked like they tossed it in the bag. The hashbrowns were not crispy. \n\nMy exact comment to my husband was \"we won't have to worry about any of this because when we get home from vacation, I am cooking all our meals\". \n\nThe only plus is this location doesn't have the \"new\" straw stripper that half way inserts the straw into your drink. I hate that because on more than one time I have slurped up a wad of straw paper. Poses a choking hazard and initiates my sensitive gag reflux when your not expecting to slurp up a chunk lol \nDisappointed is an understatement"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst McDonalds in Las Vegas. In the past year I have been maybe 6 times due to its proximity to my house. There has not been a visit where something did not get messed up...from a simple ketchup request to forgetting basic parts of the meal. In my most recent visit (4/4 @ approx. 7:45pm should management actually read these) the employee at the last window was so stoned he could not comprehend anything. He then proceeded to forget my sons cheeseburger and forget my ketchup packet request in the 10 ft he walked to get the food. The food is always poorly made and never hot when I receive it. I try to limit my McDonalds trips, however after 6 tries I will completely eliminate this McDonalds. Ownership and Management must be uninvolved or incompetent at this location."}
{"text":"The employees here totally love their jobs; I can tell. They are just so enthusiastic about working at McDonalds and they just can't contain it. If they were in a Disney movie, there would be one heck of a musical number about it.\n\nAlright, not really. But they work at McDonalds. Can you really blame them for being blas√© about it?\n\nThe wait in the drive thru is almost always pretty long. The food is standard McDonalds food. I haven't had any issues with my order being incorrect."}
{"text":"Service rude and never heard of this but they said from now on they take cash only WTF"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. When I walked to the counter, the manager was on a personal cell phone call. Walked away from the counter and proceeded to say the \"F\" word multiple times. After it was brought to his attention, the drive through attendant started cussing the \"N\" word. Regardless if this is McDonald's or a higher end place, professionalism should be shown. Thankfully my child wasn't with me to witness such trash."}
{"text":"I don't eat at McDonald's so I can't comment on that, but their smoothies and frappe's are on point and the staff is always friendly at this location."}
{"text":"We ordered breakfast to go. Got to the car, opened our sandwich & realized it was the wrong one. Went back in & showed the kid at the counter it was wrong. He had no problem getting us the right sandwich, but he took the sandwich we had in our car and had opened, rewrapped it & put it back in the warming tray . Not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and my daughter. While giving my order (with my family next to me), the MANAGER named Ricardo, kept WINKING at me. Yes, the manager. Not once but many times. \n\nit took everything in me to calm my husband down and not let him deck the guy. I told my husband that I would report it. \n\nGetting home, I called and reported the situation to corporate. they said I would receive a call from someone immediately.\n\nTori, the district manager called me the next day and gave me the lamest excuse Ive ever heard. Her exact words were, \"Well, he does that to everyone, its just who he is. I mean, he even winks at me all the time and I'm not eve a pretty woman.\" Um, okay?! How does this make it right. i was furious and told her so. She continued to defend his actions saying he does it all the time. Excuse me, but I was a manager at a restaurant once upon a time and 1. winking is considered sexual harassment. 2. Its not appropriate for him to do that to a customer and definitely not his boss, the district manager. If he is allowed to do that and get a way with it, I can't imagine what he does to the female workers under him.\n\nCalled corporate again and yet, again nothing done. Not even an apology.\n\nUsed to come here all the time for a happy meal for my little girl but now i will NEVER come back to this mcdonalds and maybe never give another mcdonalds a chance. This situation made me sick and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Very surprised with this location. Just goes to show you, bad reviews for a fast food chain are often meaningless. \n\nThe service here was nothing to write home about, we waited a long time in the drive thru line, but all the food we got was piping hot, fresh, and delicious. Completely satisfied and happy with the above average McDonalds quality."}
{"text":"This was completely terrible. I ordered a smoothie and it was terrible. I saw cockroaches on the floor. Was completely disgusting...."}
{"text":"I went into this Mc Donalds bec there was 12 cars in the drive thru and when I got inside.. it was complete chaos !! It took 4 people to fig out how to work the register, while the fry machine was beeping beeping beeping .... One girl was texting on her cell phone and with 5 people in line, the young inexperienced manager went and sat down in the rest. and got on phone.  They were rude and it was unacceptable !! Horrible service and products !!"}
{"text":"I'll see you in The  court..\nThank you McDonalds for the cheeseburger with HAIR !!"}
{"text":"So when I checked in here, there was a wait at the drive thru and I was looking over reviews and I couldn't imagine a McDonald's being THAT bad. Well.. It was. No pickles on my burger, my drink had no ice and wasn't full, and the fries were lukewarm at best. Next time I'll be headed to the location on buffalo and flamingo."}
{"text":"There's always a line when I go to this McDonalds. I usually go through drive-thru and service is normal, but wait time is LONG. I come here when I'm desperate and don't' know what else to eat."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this McDonald's I order my food, they give it to me, and then I eat it."}
{"text":"Yo I know you're 24 hours it was only 12:30 and we sat at the drive thru for 20 minutes making eye contact with 3 associates and they still didn't come take our order or to tell us they were closed, cmon man im just tryna satisfy my munchies"}
{"text":"This location is closest to my house so we go, but every time they get our order wrong! This am hubby went and ordered me the mcmuffins that are on special without sausage as always, and the woman would not give it to him for the deal. Excuse me - same sandwich minus the sausage! It's actually saving them money. So instead the woman decides to put egg and cheese mcmuffins instead which comes with ham. That is NOT what I ordered!!!! If I wanted meat on my sandwich I would have ordered it that way but I'm a vegetarian meaning I DO NOT EAT MEAT! So in good nature I removed the ham from my sandwich but could still taste the yuck flavor of the meat, and thinking to myself what has customer service come to?! I thought they're slogan was make it your way at least one time or another.  They also originally forgot my oatmeal and my hubby's sandwich too. Not to mention when ordering through the drive thru after ordering 1 thing they say,\"Is that it?\" No I still have 10 more things to order and after each item I order they say that. Really?! Shouldn't they say something along the lines of\"is there anything else I can make for you/get for you?\" The way the say it makes me and I'm sure others feel as we are inconveniencing them to do their job they get paid to do. So what exactly are you paying then for?! Poor customer service, loosing profits  because of incorrect orders irate customers that won't return and I could go on. If this is what they get paid to do then each of them should get a raise!!!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give no stars!!!! But to write a review I had to give this horrible piece of sh$% place a star. Okay let's start off with the lack of attention. This place couldn't have more incompetent people working if you paid them to be incompetent. I've lived here in Mesa for more than 20 years and have seen this place go down hill more and more each day with the lack of good employees.  My mother just had to have McDonald tonight and what a shocking surprise... As I'm in the drive-thru this car pulls up behind me with a bunch of dumb asses yelling and being just as I said (dumb asses). Of course once I pull up pay and move on to the next window what do I see???? Oh the employee I just paid for my food hanging out the window and snort cocaine given by the person in the vehicle behind me!!!! Seriously! Do you not have cameras either? Do you not drug test these morons handling your money and food everyday? And they ask to get paid more???? Are you fn kidding me!!!! $15.00 an hour my \na$$!!!"}
{"text":"I went in there last night and got a quarter pounder with cheese, fries and a diet coke.  First of all, this place is F___g filthy, I mean the worst I've ever seen at a McDonald's.   I'm not a clean freak by any means, and there's no way I'd let my kid play in that playground.  It looked filthy, can you imagine how much shit there is that you can't see?  And I mean that literally too.  Garbage cans overflowing, drink station with trash all over the place, dirty tables, etc.  And to top it off, I could tell that my sandwich had been sitting around for hours because it was almost like eating sandpaper.  I ended up throwing it away, and throwing food away is not something I do very often, that's for sure.  French fries were good and fresh though, at least there's that."}
{"text":"This is actually the slowest fucking McDonalds I've ever been to. Avoid at all costs or lick the pavement out front instead"}
{"text":"This McDonald's is the closest to my house so every once in a while we go there because my son loves the Happy Meals. I am pretty sure the people working here are just completely incompetent and do not give a crap about their customers. The drive through always takes 20+ minutes on a slow day so I took my son inside to get a Happy Meal as a reward for good grades. It is absolutely filthy and the area where you get soda has ketchup and soda caked on there like no one ever cleans it. I let my son play while I ordered his food and I got myself an iced tea. Of course they forgot my iced tea, and I had to ask for it once more, but there was a man who had been waiting there to get ice cream for over 15 minutes while the manager claimed the machine was down. The man came back up and SAW her serving ice cream to the people in the drive thru, and making him wait. Not only that, but they were extremely rude to him and kicked him out because he claimed they were treating him unfairly and their customer service sucks (which it totally does). This is NOT the first time this place has had someone yelling at the staff for their awful service and rude attitudes while I've been there. Honestly I wouldn't give this establishment any stars, but I had to give it 1 at least to write a horrible review about them. Do not waste your money here!!"}
{"text":"I like Mc'd's  but I had an experience here to top all crappy service and dirty dining rooms  ever experienced. I had to endure the lard laden ass of an employee sweeping the floor wearing pants 7 sizes too small. Seriously. the pants covered only about half her ass and the rest was hanging out. Right in my face. After that I notice the drive thru server starting to fistfight with a customer, so I left. This is a great country...unfortunately a lot of the people SUCK !"}
{"text":"My first and last McGriddle experience took place at this McDonald's. Folks, it doesn't get any classier from here.\n\nI ordered a Bacon, Egg & Cheese McGriddle and specifically requested a round egg. Instead, I got a McGriddle with a fake ass jiggly-yellow thing that McDonald's calls an \"egg.\"  I know most of the \"food\" that McDonald's serves is fake, but at least give me a real egg to make me feel a little better about eating here. Anyway, the McGriddle wasn't great, and it wasn't bad either. The pancake part was DENSE...you could probably use it to smack someone.\n\nHash browns were all right, and the apple pie was disappointing, no wonder they're always trying to get rid of it when you place an order.  I'm not expecting Marie Calendar's quality pie, but I don't remember the apple pies tasting so bland. I also tried half of their \"Egg\" McMuffin because a whole one probably would've made me barf from all the saltiness."}
{"text":"Came here because it was the closest but now I have regretted coming here, had my order wrong and the manager don't care about customer service had to many missing many missing items. I was to upset to turn around and ask for the missing items so this will be my last visit here, this place needs new management and new staff."}
{"text":"I stopped by this McDonalds yesterday to pick up breakfast for my wife and son. To find when I get home that they had not given me half my order. Being in a time crunch I decided to call, The manager acknowledge that they knew they had left things out on accident and so i tried to tell them to refund my card but I was told they could not do that and that if I wanted to I could come in the next morning and they would give me what they had forgot to give me. I was not happy about having to go back but I did. Now I'm even more unhappy after going there this morning and trying to get what they forgot to give me. The manager was rude and acted like I was wasting her time to get my food that they had forgot to give me. So after giving me some cold mcmuffins, no apology  and could not even offer me a free cup of coffee for my major inconvenience. I left and will never go back to this McDonald's. I know people make mistakes but it's how you correct those mistakes and the customer service you give when you make a mistake that matters. Corporate needs to help this McDonald's get it together!"}
{"text":"Someone from corporate needs to come here and train the night staff. They got no integrity giving stale fries and stale hot N spicy mcchickens. I worked fast food and seen things which pisses me off. \n1. They redump their fries to make it seem like it was cooked fresh \n2. The mcchicken has probably  been sitting for so long and they just redumped it into the fryer like the fries and it was just hard to chew. \n\nOverall just like most places their frappe or ice cream machine is \"broken\".\n\nWorking at fast food, those two things don't break down every night around the same time, unless you're cleaning them and if so be damn honest. I'm sorry this is just disappointing"}
{"text":"I would have given 0 stars if I could have.  First I was in the drive through and had to back out. Why? Because the sign stated ONLY CASH will be accepted due to the card machines not working.  After I walked into the restaurant to let a petite blonde worker know, she looked disgusted. I thought if you hate your job that much get an education, learn a trade or apply for a job you do like. I requested to speak to a manager since the business should be made aware of the signs. There was even a typo. In this age of spellcheck -seriously?! \n\nThe shift manager wasn't wearing a nametag and neither was the irritated petite blonde. I stated the problem to the shift manager and was informed that the card machines do work, sometimes . This begs the question of why maintenance isn't the norm. She asked if I was ordering or not. I answered in the affirmative.  I  ordered and requested a Mocha Frappuccino which was replacing the medium drink in the 2 cheeseburger meal. I was charged extra but didn't go back since the Friday night crowd was in force. My order wasn't read back to me and it was my fault that I didn't bring it to the unconcerned manager's attention.( I was at home when I read the receipt.)\n \nMy husband said the food was okay.\n\nI compared my experience to other people's experiences in my community.  One neighbor stated that this location has rude employees and he drives 3+ miles to another McDonald's. Another neighbor just shook her head. I wish that I had the district manager's telephone number to let him/her know how bad my experience was."}
{"text":"I stop by this MCD's drive thru often when I'm on my way to/from the Clark County Shooting Park. This one is fast and my order has never been messed up. I pull up, order, pay and am off with my food. Never have to wait around much, which is exactly the point of going to a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to this McD's there's a mix up. I ordered a Filet O Fish & Dr. Pepper, they give me 2 Big Macs w/small fry & Coke! Ugh lucky I caught it before I put the petal to the metal leaving the drive-thru. The drive thru never seems to be too busy nevertheless the employees are too dam slow..Today there was a supervisor with a walkie talkie giving directions to drive thru cashier. I seen his body through window ummm okay so what's the point? Micro managing for sake of a superhero sticker on his name tag, in the meantime he can be passing out the right orders to the customers. So the line isn't held up. Ridiculous!! 3 people to get 1 order straight. Come on now. Furthermore HELL YES ID GO BACK BECAUSE ITS MCD'S AND THE DAM LOCATION IS CONVENIENT PLUS WELLS FARGOS  HAS A DRIVE UP ATM NEXT DOOR. I CAN DRIVE THROUGH BOTH IN UNDER A MINUTE....plus if they do give you your receipt, you'll get a FREE APPLE PIE!! yum yum"}
{"text":"This McDonald's is a very busy location.  The food tastes pretty much the same as any other McDonald's.  They do, however, need to work on the quality of their breakfast all day food.  I recently tried to have breakfast for lunch and will never make that mistake again. My egg McMuffin was burned and the egg was rubbery.  It looked like something that was left over from breakfast that they tried to reheat.  \n\nThe inside of the restaurant is usually very clean with seating options varying from booths, to tables with chairs, to high tables with stools.  There isn't a play area at this location. There's usually a wait to order and to get your food. The parking lot is very small and hard to get in and out of with the way the drive thru line blocks cars that are parked.  My car was hit by a hit and run driver while I was inside just to buy a drink.  Very expensive drink!!"}
{"text":"The people running this place are imbeciles. The two new ordering drive thrus are complete chaos. There is no system on you ordered you're next. Cars are completely cutting other cars off. \n\nNow to what was just witnessed. We ordered two medium chocolate shakes. They made one medium one large. They realized their mistake, but instead of just giving us the large, they threw it away and made a medium. How freaking wasteful. I saw a manager walking around, but he wasn't really doing anything but standing there. So he saw this happen and just let it go. This is 6:00 at night and the line just keeps backing up."}
{"text":"Drove through the drive thur. It wasn't busy either. Ordered cheeseburger meal with no onions. I got the complete opposite.  Only onions and the hamburger patty.  When I tried to call( twice) to speak to a Manager, no one answered the phone. Ugh"}
{"text":"The slowest McDonalds on the planet. Fast food is false advertisement. Prepare to wait atleast 20-30 minutes after placing your order."}
{"text":"The woman over the drive-through mic was pleasant and had a good sense of humor. She informed me of the coffee special and $1 coffee makes me very happy.\n\nThat was it. I wanted fast, in & out coffee and got great service and a good product at a good price. \n\nI don't really eat fast food, but if I was going to, I would go back to this McDonalds."}
{"text":"I recognize that after midnight might appear to be late, but c'mon, guys, this is Las Vegas!  After having dinner on the Las Vegas Strip and catching Jubilee at the Flamingo, my wife and I decided to cap off date night with an ice cream cone and hot apple pie from McDonalds on the way home.\n\nNo dice.  Despite the long line at the drive thru, we were informed that the ice cream machine was down.  No problem, we thought, just give us our hot apple pies and we'll take a latte to share.\n\nNow, the fact that the package the apple came in read \"Caution: HOT!\" led me to believe that the apple pie would actually be, you know, hot.  My handy dandy insta-read thermometer informs me that the actual temperature of my \"HOT!\" apple pie is actually 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  If I convert this temperature to Kelvin, THEN  it seems to be hot, but on both the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales this seems to be sorely lacking.\n\nC'mon guys.  It doesn't seem to much to ask that the \"HOT!\" apples pies at least be warmer than body temperature.  Given the fact that the line for the drive-thru was at least 10 cars long when we arrived, I assume that there was enough turn-over in your food inventory to ensure that the products you were selling were fresh and hot.  I am disappointed with this experience!"}
{"text":"One of my 2016 Yelp goals besides trying to hit Landmark Review #1,000 is to participate in 25 National Days off the National Day Calendar  (http://www.nationaldaycalendar.com). Yesterday, National Vanilla Ice Cream Day led me to this very Golden Arches. \n\n  The McDonald's cone of soft vanilla ice cream is a treat that brings me back to when I was a little kid in the late 1970s when my grandfather treated me to this ice cream in the Whitestone Expressway McDonald's  (Flushing, New York City). Somewhere along the way I grew tired of vanilla ice cream. This cone of soft vanilla ice cream that I celebrated on National Vanilla Ice Cream Day was the first in at twenty years. You know what? This soft vanilla ice cream in a cake cone tasted delicious and changed my negative opinion of vanilla ice cream onto a positive one. It is only $1.08 after tax and one of McDonald's best kept secrets. \n\n  It was more than vanilla ice cream that led me here. I had been hiking for hours up in Mount Charleston and was going to meet up with my brother. I was in the mood for quick, convenient, and inexpensive fast food. After hours of hiking in Mount Charleston my tired brain was in a state where McDonald's was as good as Bachi Burger. Before participating in National Vanilla Ice Cream Day, I ordered a Quarter pounder with cheese meal that came out to around $6.40. After hours of hiking in the mountains, it really hit the spot. \n\n  As far as McDonald's this is a modern location. They have the computerized menu and the screen showing the orders that are ready. There is also a mini lounge with two plush chairs. \n\n There were some opportunities in cleanliness and service. There was one very young woman that was taking orders. From my observation she seemed to be brand new which caused her to have to call the shift manager about a credit card and a customer mentioning that he waited twenty minutes for his cookies. When I left, what seemed to be an off the clock McDonald's employee was joking with an employee that he is not supposed to use that language in front of customers. As far as cleanliness, the trash buckets at the Coke machines were also overflowing. In reality this is the quintessential McDonald's. \n\n  In my opinion McDonald's is solid but not great fast food. However, childhood memories of the McDonald's cone of soft vanilla ice cream led me to this location that is between Mount Charleston and my brother's house to celebrate National Vanilla Ice Cream Day. Preceding the vanilla ice cream cone, I enjoyed an inexpensive, fast, and convenient post-hiking dinner."}
{"text":"I like this location because it is open 24 hours inside and the drive-thru. I prefer eating inside because I like to enjoy my meal when it is freshly made.\n\nThere is probably usually only 1 or 2 staff working late at night. They're pretty chill and it is never busy inside when I went here a few times early in the morning. \n\nThere were a few nights where they only accepted cash only or their \"machines were down\" but I never really had a problem.\n\nMy food comes out in a decent amount of time. Tables are always clean. It is pretty peaceful eating here late at night"}
{"text":"Really pathetic!  I guess they ran out of ground beef patties!  This is totally unacceptable!  Take your business some place else!"}
{"text":"Unlike other reviewers, I often eat at McDonald's, and even used to work there. This McDonald's is not up to standard. The Nuggets are dry, our Shamrock shake is unmixed, and taste like toothpaste mixed with vanilla ice cream. They don't even offer diet Dr Pepper here :( I know McDonald's is supposed to be a place for fast cheap food, But there needs to be some pride in your work. It's pretty bad when you ask for a large water, they charge you for a sweet tea, and then get confused when you tell them you ordered a water and they try and hand You tea. This is one location you might only want to try if you have no other options or you're under enough influence to not care."}
{"text":"I opened my cheeseburger that I just ordered in the drive thru and a cockraoch came crawling out.  I threw away my entire meal and my daughters.  I called the location to let them know and I the lady could say was \" Sorry, what do want me to do?\"  Wow, thats it thats the reaapons for bugs in their food.  I wonder if the employees wash their hands or is that not enforced either."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS LOCATION LIKE THE PLAGUE.  Hadn't been to McDonalds in years after watching the movie \"Supersize Me.\"  Read about the new CEO trying to turn things around so I ordered one of their Steakhouse sirloin burgers for $5.00 to try to be supportive.  I have to say I feel violated.  This is absolutely the worst burger I have ever had, especially at that price.  The thing was tough and like cardboard.  The mushrooms and onions had partially dissolved into some kind of goo and the cheese slice was so thin and really small.  If your business is going down the tubes because of the perception of low quality and you keep putting out junk like this I don't see how you're going to make it.  \n\nWhat a rip off.  I will never go to McDonalds again and I recommend you don't either."}
{"text":"I go to McDonald's a lot because it's convenient when I'm getting off from work... But this is the slowest McDonald's in the world!!! Every freaking time!!! So this last time I'm in a rush and I see a line at the drive thru so I decide I'll go inside since there drive thru sucks here... I get inside and there's 2 people ahead of me.... Took them about 5mins to ask me for my order (not bad) so I place a order for two mcchickens and a large fry... I'm waiting and waiting and waiting watching all 7 employees take there sweet time... One manager is just standing there talking to 2 employees about who's going in break next and joking around but none of them were working ! The whole time I'm giving them the death stare!!! Did I mention I was in a rush??? I finally got my food 20 mins later... I realized priority goes to drive thru customers first... I could have went thru the drive thru 10 times smh"}
{"text":"I understand that this is a McDonald's, so what did I expect? I used to work in this shopping center so I ended up at it a shameful amount. They have always, always been a hot mess. \n\nStill, I always seem to forget and give it another chance, but I had the worst fast food experience of my life here a few weeks ago. \n\nIt was about 11:30 p.m. when I pulled into the drive-thru, with 4 cars ahead of me. I place my order and pull up a little bit. That was the last time I moved for the next 20 minutes. It is not an exaggeration. The drive-thru is set up so that there is absolutely no way you can get out of it once you're in it. I was trapped in this stupid drive-thru for what felt like an eternity, and I hadn't even paid.\n\nWhen I finally get to the first window, there is nobody there. After about a minute the girl came scurrying in and had to ask me what I had ordered. Holy. Crap. (As a side note, cashier girl, if you ever read this, I'm sorry I was kind of rude to you. I felt pretty bad about it. It wasn't your fault.)\n\nAnyway, after finally paying, we're stuck again. While I'm waiting, I can see the food window handing bags and taking them back from the car that's there currently. Great, they're messing up orders. The next car has the same situation.\n\nI get up to the window and the guy hands me a bag that is very clearly not my food based on the size, but I checked anyway. Nope. I wait for him to come back and tell him, and he grabs the other bag that had been sitting there since before I even got to the window and hands me that one instead. No apology, nothing. He didn't even look inside either of the bags.\n\nThe worst part of all of it is that after this 30-minute journey, my fries were so cold. So, so cold. Hot McDonald's fries are the only reason to go to McDonald's! At that point, I just wanted to get as far away as possible from this place. \n\nIt should never be so hard to get terrible food. I always go to McDonald's with hardly any expectation, but somehow this one always seems to surprise me. Wait through the light at 215 and go to Burger King instead if you've got a hankering for $1 burgers."}
{"text":"These guys are great.  They rarely mix up or make errors on orders. Drive thru moves quickly. Staff is friendly and professional.  My favorite mcd in the NW."}
{"text":"Give your customers condiments when they request them! Stop hoarding ketchup and stop being so rude when they have to request it multiple times! Get it together McDonald's seriously!"}
{"text":"First of all I never eat McD's.  I have it maybe once a year.  I just do not care for it.  I was having a bad day and was short on time so I decided to stop at this location.  The fries were cold when they hit the bag.  I had some Habenaro bacon burger is what I ordered.  I do not think that is what I got becuase there was not even a tickle of hot on this burger.  Also the burgers from here are always small and wimpy.  Needless to say I still do not care for McD's and this visit made me realize why. Thank you!.  Now maybe it will be a visit every two years.  Dollar menu is the best thing going for any of the locations."}
{"text":"Let's face it - many of us have grown up with the Golden Arches somewhere near us, and every once in a while we will have the craving for something from here.\n\nSorry military folks - You are out of luck getting a discount here. I have tried asking if they do before - but have been told no. This last visit I tried to ask the Manager on Duty if they would be implementing such a policy in the forseeable future (very politely). Manager didn't even come to the window to talk to me, and just shook the head, then turned off and walked away. I felt that was kind of rude of a manager to not even speak to me, after asking nicely to do so!\n\nHave to admit, I was disappointed with my last Drive Thru visit (happened about 2 weeks ago). During their busy lunch hours they will post a person outside to take orders. The young lass I ordered through, I specifically asked for no fries in the kiddy meal, and replace the fries with the apple slices (I was going to share the ones from my order with my child). She got the order right - but the staff fulfilling the order did not. I also stated my child was a girl - and I got a boy kiddy meal instead - we were already home so it was too late to return the order. Granted this was a first time something like this has happened, but - there wasn't a huge lunch line (inside or drive tru wise). The fries were stale, and borderline lukewarm, and my sandwich was lukewarm (2nd time this has happened).\n\nDon't know if this is a sign of decline for this franchise location or not - but I'd rather migrate to other places for now. I don't frequent this place that much anyways for health sake!"}
{"text":"11pm on Aug 31. Fries were room temperature and very stale. Sandwiches were slightly warm and sloppily put together. These people put in zero effort."}
{"text":"This review is purely for the state of disarray that the women's bathroom was in. It's not that it was disgustingly dirty. It just lacked some basic but very necessary attention. \nThe first issue was that the toilet paper holder was empty. But wait-it wasn't complete panic cause lo and behold some clever (or lazy, I suppose) individual had a roll placed on top of the trash can behind the toilet provided for sanitary napkins and such. I just can't...\nNext, I go to the sink to wash my hands and notice a rather large brown paper bag sitting on top of the counter. 'Oh shoot,' I thought, 'some poor homeless person has left their bag here.' But wait again-it wasn't the property of the homeless! It was full of napkins and placed there by an enterprising (or lazy, I suppose again) individual in lieu of filling the proper paper towel dispenser. In what's becoming a pattern at this Mickey D's, again I just can't...\nThere's really no excuse for this in the public restroom of a restaurant. I seriously left without getting food cause I'm concerned that if the bathroom is that sketchy, the kitchen must be downright frightening. And I ain't lovin' that!"}
{"text":"Only McDonald's we come to, fresh food, & fast, great employees who will tell you how to save money by making certain things a meal when you didn't realize it"}
{"text":"The worse McDonalds franchise I've ever visited throughout the U.S. They NEVER get the order right. If you're in the drive-thru you better check your order before you leave. And they skimp on the French fries! You order a medium fry they put small and you order a large they don't fill that one up either. I've given them chance after chance. This is the closest McDonald's to me but I've gotten to the point to where I'll drive down 215 to the McDonald's off Durango exit instead. HORRIBLE!!! Something needs to change. Ownership or better training for employees!"}
{"text":"Was Starvin' like Marvin yesterday morning and went to the drive thru to grab something on the way to an early morning meeting.  While I don't eat at McDonald's too often, this one in particular was impressive....why?  Well, for starters they open both drive thru windows, which makes it go 2x faster.....many fast food places no longer open the second window and it takes forever to get through.\n\nI ordered 2 Sausage McMuffin Sandwiches and a Bottle of Water.  The service was quick, the food was hot and fresh.  What more could I ask for?\n\nWill I return?  Next time I'm in a pinch for breakfast, you bet!"}
{"text":"It was a slow Saturday afternoon the store wasn't too busy but when I rolled up and ordered about $10 worth of food and paid with $100 bill they were able to cash it so I'm happy about that."}
{"text":"I use to work at the Costco in front of this McDonalds so it was pretty much my sole food option for lunch at work. I am worn out on this food for a decade or two, but the service was always pretty good, and the drive thru was always really fast, so ther's not much to complain about here."}

{"text":"Someone Needs to train the night people,  everytime i order here my food isnt fresh, some fries are hot and some cold and have no salt and they dont even offer you ketchup or napkins. I live across the street from here but after my bad experiences here i go to a different location, no matter the distance. Please make some improvements here"}
{"text":"Come here if you want to wait 20 minutes to place an order with a worker that just doesn't care. Perhaps he's too cool to work? I'm not sure."}
{"text":"We generally try to avoid eating McDonald's food, but will occasionally stop in for a coffee drink or one of their smoothies, which aren't too high in calories (although I'm sure they are ripe with other less than great stuff).  The problem with this place is that they consistently under fill their smoothies, and only the smoothies. Every single time. I've attached a picture with about 2/3 of an inch of empty space in the cup.  \n\nInitially I thought this was due to their auto-fill system being set up that way, but if you go to other McDonald's they fill the cups up completely with the smoothies.  Not so here.  Either they have their machine set up incorrectly or its an effort to cut costs by management.  Under either situation its just not acceptable."}
{"text":"On my way home after ending my work day late on the eve of my Christmas vacation I decided to celebrate (and fill my empty stomach) with a quick snack.  I wasn't to excited to go to a McDonalds in between a Costco and WalMart especially on Christmas week, but I was pleasantly surprised the place was not over crowded.  I went through the drive through because I was anxious to get home and relax.  Although there was 3 cars in front of me I made it through quickly.  Had something to do with both Drive-thru windows open and the dude taking the order was competent and friendly.\n\nI ordered a Mint Mocha with my fries (strange combination I know) and it was delightful.  Could have been a little bit hotter, but other than that it was enjoyable.\n\nOverall I have a pleasant experience at this MD's.  A rare occurrence these days."}
{"text":"Standing in the lobby for 10 mins waiting to place my order and the girl in the back hasn't even acknowledged my presence. \n\nGuess I'm invisible or something. \n\nGreat customer service."}
{"text":"I drove to this McDonald's at 9:00pm, I then waited in a drive-thru line for about ten minutes before I was able to order. (I know I could've gone in, but I was already in my PJs). So I ordered a mcflurry, and was told to pull up to the second window. The guy said, \"you're going to be mad at me, but our ice cream machine is off now\" WTF? So I've waited 15 mins at this point and ask to speak to the manager. She says that they can turn it back on and it will be ready in 2-3 mins and to park in front. I waited 18 minutes in front until a guy came out and told me the ice cream machine is still off and is going to stay off. So you just had me wait 35 minutes for no fucking reason, and let's add 10 mins for the refund cause apparently it's difficult to refund 2 bucks. This McDonald's SUCKS."}
{"text":"Went to drive thru to get a ice cream sunda. Went to drive through to find out the machine was not working. Well because the drive through line was long had no choice but to sit and drive through. Drove to the window to ask a simple question. \" Is there any reason you could not put up a sign saying machine is broken? \" The assistant mangers answer was I told the manager. Wow what a very poor answer to give a customer. There is always a issue with this place. This place is a complete joke and it is to bad Noone cares."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and so filthy!!!!!!! The people running this location are rude and that reflects on their employees. Never going to this location again, it's worth the drive to a different location."}
{"text":"Where do I begin! Some hate it, and some are 'lovin' it', but personally, it's a love-hate relationship.\n\nBut I can't stick with McD because a steady relationship w/ it not be the best for my body. But again, I love many of their sandwiches. Some criticize it's taste, ingredients, whatever. I think the Big Mac, Quarter Pounders, and even the Cheeseburgers taste good. Yes, I also have an issue with the nuggets but I hear they fixed that problem.\n\nThe reason I'm not an official fan here is because of the crowd and sanitary conditions in some places. The one I go to is fine though. Anyway, we all know we all go from time to time. So, bottom line, I'm okay with McDs!"}
{"text":"Newly minted McDonald's. Double drive thru which they actually utilize. You definitely get through the line faster."}
{"text":"Clean and updated McDonald's with the new menu board, serve-yourself soda (Coca-Cola products) and a ketchup dispenser. Yes, they have a drive through as well. As McD's go, I thought that this was a decent one."}
{"text":"Who rates a McDonald's?  I do.  My wife got off work, and she was hungry and tired.  She ordered some Big Macs from McDonald's, and they left out half of the order.  This place is not nearby, it is a detour from her return home but there is a lot of traffic and poor layout due to construction (thanks to the light rail) involved with this McDonald's.  Simply giving us what we are owed isn't good service, doing it right the first time is expected - forcing me to make a 25 minute each way trip is ridiculous.  Arguments were had over the rule to always check your food when you get it from this type of place (argued with Wifey - not McDonald's).  Regardless we went back.  I received my Big Macs but other problems ensued.  The McDonald's app wasn't working - my Android phone picked up the wifi at the place and it wasn't working.  I suspect I needed to open a browser and get a redirect to accept some terms of service.  The phone unbeknownst to me at the time was refusing to load the app as it reached out through an non-functional wifi connection.  It refused to use my 4G connection.  I can't completely blame McDonald's for this - it is a combination of Google's and my fault too.  That slowed down the ordering considerably.  I also ordered large fries - during the McDonalds Monopoly game.  I didn't get my Monopoly game pieces on the large fries.  This is annoying.  I just want to not have to keep looking over everything they do at this McDonald's.  This is not the case.  For a McDonald's I rate this a 1 star - not versus a real restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Super slowww. Always mess up my order and coffee in the morning. Long waits in the drive through. Most of the time they have issue with the drive thru and have to order at window. Pain in the ass experience here. Food  is what it is at McDonald's it's the service that defines you as a business. Employees need a smile on their face and a thank you have a nice day would help."}
{"text":"I have atempted to eat here several times for breakfast. The clowns that work here are either very LAZY or the restaurant it self is sorry!  They take for ever to come to the drive through speaker only to tell me they have no cook, the card machine isn't working or they have no cash.  They are Very RUDE and nasty speaking. I will never stop by this McDonald's again. I will drive 5 miles  to eat somewhere else. The owners need to visit for sure."}
{"text":"I give up. No more McDonalds! How hard is it to serve a burger that is warmer than room temp?! It's not artisan sandwiches that will will, but the basics. Go back to good Customer Service and hot fresh foods!"}
{"text":"Great decor comparing to other McDonald's, and is located at the heart of the central station. The food is extremely overpriced though."}
{"text":"It gets a bit sketchy after business hours but it's otherwise a huge relief since most other places close very early.\n\nVery well located for those waiting to travel and the service and food is better than most locations"}
{"text":"Nice roomy Mc Donald's and it gets crowded during breakfast hours.\n\nThey completely screwed up my order once, ugh!!! I asked them to remove the cheese from my McMuffin and they took out the Canadian Bacon instead! Duh!!!"}
{"text":"McDonald's is McDonald's -- you know what to expect, right?\nUsually yes. But not at this one store. I have repeatedly been served cold coffee, to the point of bringing it up to management's attention a couple of times (not that it helped though). With a Tim Horton's and two Starbucks within a couple of minute's walking distance I've decided to take my business elsewhere.."}
{"text":"I decided to try one of the custom (\"gourmet\") burgers at this place during a return visit here.\n\nI basically ordered my burger on the touch screen, deciding what I wanted and seeing the additional cost (if any) of the topping/garnish. For the burger, I could choose almost everything from the type of cheese, the type of bun (or lack of bun), to the garnish/condiment. The only thing that I believe that I couldn't choose was the type of patty and it was an angus patty. I chose what I wanted on my burger and then opted for a combo (so also got fries and a drink). The display/ordering terminal asked me what device number I had so I grabbed one of the devices next to the display/ordering terminal and entered the code. I then paid with my credit card and got my receipt.\n\nI went to sit on one of the tables with a sign on them and a few minutes later, one of the McDonald's employees walked over to my table to look at the number of the device that I took as well as my receipt. She then left an a few minutes later, she brought my drink.\n\nIt took ~12 minutes for them to bring my order to my table so it was longer than a \"usual\" order. This location can get very busy since it is located inside Central Station so I can easily see it taking longer than the ~12 minutes that my order took to reach my table. Since it takes me roughly 20 minutes to get to this place via walking through the \"underground city\" from where I work and another 20 minutes to get back to work, it doesn't leave a lot of time so even though I liked the burger, I don't see myself re-ordering it because of the price as well as the time needed."}
{"text":"It's a McD's, so it's fast food. What do you expect? The reason for the one star is service. This morning I pulled up to the window ordering a bacon egg and cheese bagel. A sandwich that's a pretty popular seller. I was asked to pull forward and they would bring it out to me. Standard procedure that's fine. So I pulled up to the spot and was listening my podcast. As I listen to my podcast I saw eight cars call behind me and leave. After sitting for five minutes I turned off my car and wanted to see what the problem was. I went in and told the girl at the counter that I've been waiting for five minutes for a sandwich.  My suspicions were correct, I had been forgotten. The manager seemed a little put off with my frustration. After I reiterated to her that I had been waiting five minutes for a sandwich that many people have gotten after me she merely gave me an apple pie. An actual apology that sounded believable would've been appreciated much more."}
{"text":"Slowest McDonalds I've ever been to. Unfortunately I have to go here sometimes because it's one of very few places between the Cleveland clinic and the interstate. Right now I am pulled ahead of the drive through window waiting on my grilled chicken sandwich. It's going on 18 minutes now...after driving away, found out they didn't put any sauce on my sandwich."}
{"text":"This is a busy McDonald's location. I never use the drive through so I always park and walk in.\n\nService has always been friendly and fast and i've never had a problem with any of my orders."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited a half hour for a small iced coffee. The people said it'd be a different price first and when I ordered it gave me a significantly higher different price. These people who work here have no idea of any of the items served and have horrible customer service. This place is a big mess."}

Our order was simple, but we had to repeat it multiple times in response to \"Whaaa?\" coming from the order box. Then, when the voice from the box repeated our order, it was wrong! Then, when we went to the pay window, they asked if our order was correct and it absolutely wasn't! Then, when we went to the food window, we asked for ketchup and were told it was in the bag. We dug in, found no ketchup but a TON of salt packets. Luckily, my boyfriend is a ketchup hoarder, so we had a bunch of little packets on hand. \n\nOverall, the debacle started off comically difficult and ended up disappointing and a bit enraging. Mostly, I was mad because we were lied to! The ketchup was a lie!! \n\nNow, I can't lie. I'll probably be back, because my expectations for McD's aren't too high and I like french fries."}
{"text":"This review screams \"First World Problems\"...but until Yelp opens up a site that allows us to review establishments in the \"Third World\" (can one even still use that term without being offensive?), I guess all of the things about which we gripe will be \"First World Problems,\" won't they?\n\nAnyhow, my wife was hungry one evening so we stopped here to grab a bite to eat through the drive-thru. We actually enjoy eating at McDonald's in general and think the food is good (some people will probably find that statement more offensive than the above comments about terminology!), so it's not like this was a bad option. We actually used to stop at this one pretty often on our way home from church when we lived on the East Side and we generally received great service.\n\nUnfortunately, tonight was a night on which we received awful service.\n\nWhen we pulled up to the drive-through, the McDonald's employee let loose with this rapid-fire barrage that was presumably supposed to tell us what food wasn't available. I'm a teacher, and I'm used to deciphering...but this was incomprehensible. Of course, when we mistakingly ordered something that was deemed off-limits, we were made to feel like buffoons.\n\nAfter we finally managed to figured out what was available, we ordered and pulled up to the window. You don't need a crystal ball to figure out what happened next--that's right, they got the order partially wrong. One of my wife's Chicken McNuggets even wound up outside of the container. Perhaps it was in a hurry to escape an environment completely void of any sort of concern for the customer, or perhaps they couldn't be bothered to take an extra second to close the container fully. I'll let you be the judge on that one. They also gave her the wrong sauce. I had no idea that \"Sweet and Sour\" actually means \"Barbeque.\"\n\nWhy we stopped at this McDonald's instead of driving to the McDonald's on Clark--which consistently provides amazing customer service that surely makes Ray Kroc smile in his grave--is beyond me. Live and learn."}
{"text":"This is a busy location on Carnegie, near a neighborhood that is not the greatest.  That being said, the service is usually great going through the drive through.  Wait times are usually appropriate to the length of the line.  Food is well prepared, and servers are friendly.  Not a big fan of McD's, but this is a good location."}
{"text":"I gave McDonald's another shot after not visiting for years. I regret that choice. \n\nI waited 20 minutes, with one person in front of me, at the drive thru. When I asked about the long wait, the employee told me \"we're close to closing\" as he ate a chicken nugget. WHAT."}
{"text":"Joe'd again.  Came in & saw they had power plugs so that I could enjoy my time here while I waited for me daughter to finish choir practice.\n\nBot my lunch, and took a seat. \"Joe'd\"...power plugs don't work...Not a one of them.\n\nI asked if a fuse blew or what.  They said a electrician was coming in.\n\nService was good, and the food is McDonalds, I just would have went somewhere else had I known they didn't have power."}
{"text":"The worst McDonald's I've ever been to . I will not eat from a Micky D's again. The people they had working were rude and very unprofessional. The food was sloppy looking and their fries were cold. #NeverAgain"}

{"text":"This location is really phoning it in. All McDonalds are supposed to serve breakfast all day now, but they'll claim they don't serve it here. That's fine; I could be mistaken about the rollout. But they also like to pull the old fast food worker trick of closing down drink machines early, and then telling customers they're broken for the night. \n\nI don't get a correct order a lot of the time either, so I'm going to guess that these poor souls aren't paid enough to care."}
{"text":"\"This is America,\" I shout to my stupid wife over the speaker phone. \"And I will do as I damn well please.\"\n\n\"I just don't see the logic in eating one of everything from the dollar menu, Dale,\" my ridiculous fool of a wife replies, slightly defeated.\n\n\"I don't see the logic in buyin' all that clothes and make-up but I ain't stopping you, Claire!\" I hit the red phone doodle thing as hard as I can. Cracks the screen, actually. Doesn't matter. Nothin' is ruining ol' Dale's mood. Not tonight. For tonight, the Feast of the Dollars is upon us. \n\nI roll up on the illuminated menu like a moth to flame. All my senses buzz as I drink in the many incredibly priced options. Finally, the intercom crackles to life.\n\n\"Welcome, how may I help you this evening?\"\n\n\"I'll take one of everything on your dollar menu, good sir,\" I say, beaming. There is a long silence.\n\n\"...jeez, Dale. Again?\" The condescension in these millennials is just infuriating.\n\n\"Yeah, chief. It's the feast, kiddo. I'm a job creator!\" The idiot probably doesn't even know how economics work. It all trickles down, baby. I pull forward to the window and the pimply-faced hormone wagon says some numbers and I laugh to show 'em how little this means to me. I give him my credit card, which is declined, but it's cool because ol' Dale is never flyin' without a Plan B. I write these dopey kids a check. Someday they'll understand personal finance and checkbooks and look back and think about how prepared I was. Baller status, as the kids would say.\n\n\"Just pull forward. We'll bring it out when it's ready,\" the kid sighs. I do pull forward, and as the anticipation grows, I know it's time for the pre-feast ritual. I pop in some Pantera and just start murdering the air guitar and air drums. Seriously, you guys, you're lucky this isn't a review for Pantera air guitar and air drums because your phone would melt out of your sweaty palms, bubba.\n\nAbout halfway through \"Cowboys From Hell\" the food arrives and life just couldn't be better. This is America, y'all. A man can drive in the dead of night with something like ten pounds of toxic food while blaring Pantera, down one check, headed home to his awful wife. McDonalds. Pantera. Marriages that ain't workin'. America. Life, you guys."}
{"text":"Employees walking around on their phones behind counter, one back liner touched his hair with gloves and didn't change them, then after waiting 7 minutes for my chicken, the expediter kept telling back line that there was no order that contained the sandwich I ordered and that it shouldn't be made. At that moment they noticed there was no fresh chicken for my sandwich and that it was another 5 minute wait for my food. I have been waiting 10 minutes when this was said. The front line cashier has her phone hidden under the Cookie stand, and lastly most of the tables are dirty.

I asked what drinks they had available that were non-carbonated and the kid didn't understand and had me pull around.  I asked again, and he had to go get his manager??  Unreal.  On another visit, I sat at the window for 4 minutes without anyone coming to say anything to me.  When the person came to the window, she pushed it open, shoved the food out the window and closed it without saying a word or even making eye contact.  I know the job must suck, but come on....."}
{"text":"I only came here because I had to go to the bathroom somewhere. However, the bathroom was so nice and the people seemed so friendly that I would have felt guilty if I left without buying something. So, I bought a fruit & walnut 'salad' (which tasted bland, as all pre-packed fruits). The cashiers was super nice, offering me things (like a bag to put my 'food' in), and still being nice when I declined. What is it with Wisconsin and their nice McDonalds!?"}
{"text":"The last week before Christmas and the fridge is full of food....for family coming over this weekend. Needed one more present and since this McDonalds is the only fast food near my apartment I decided to stop in. I rolled up to the drive thru menu and realized I could not roll down my window due to the 2 day bitter cold. So I parked my car and fast walked to the door. I almost always just order sandwiches because I do not care for french fries. I ordered a fish sandwich and a Quarter Pounder with cheese, no pickle but add big mac sauce to go. I only live half a mile from there so the food still should have been hot. The burger was so cold and dry the cheese didn't even come close to be the melty goodness I was expecting and the big mac sauce I paid $.30 for was so small and right in the middle, I would say it covered maybe a quarter of the burger, hence a very dry burger. The fish sandwich had mayo, not tarter sauce but luckily I had some at home so I was able to save that sandwich. I will go out of my way to go somewhere else, this was very unsatisfying."}
{"text":"For the most part, I don't normally have issues with this location. They always get the order right tho. The 2 biggest complaints about this location is the slow speed of the staff on making the food and most of the drive-thru staff are not very friendly. The order taker is ok but the money taker is usually not friendly at all and really doesn't seem to want to be there. The food giver is generally friendly tho. They have gotten my order wrong once but that was in the drive thru. Other than that, it's ur typical McDonald's."}

But wasn't till I got back to work to find my fries 1/2 gone even before I got to them.  To add to the misery, they were very cold.  And they want a raise to $15.00/hour????  I don't think so!"}
{"text":"When we first walked into this McDonalds last night, it was definitely a nicer looking establishment vs other ones that I've seen in the past. Unfortunately my first impression was ruined by the unnecessarily rude lady behind the counter. Besides our french fries being delivered cold, I was surprised to hear \"that they weren't serving ice cream at night\". Then the guy behind me somehow gets a McFlurry. When I asked why, they said that was their last one. So why didn't I get the last one if he was behind me?"}

They had daily specials and some of them were pretty good, like 2 Big Macs for five dollars. Unfortunately they aren't having these anymore but i thought it was ver worthy of mentioning.

The drive thru is super fast so they get extra kudos and hand claps for that! My food is usually always fresh since it takes longer for them to get the breakfast items prepared!

The only thing that grinds my gears about this location is the fact they whenever I go for ice cream the machine is either down or being cleaned!!!

They charge you extra for sauce which I order at the window and then they never throw it in the bag.  Staff for the most part are friendly!"}

I know how long nuggets take to make, especially when the drive through is completely dead.\n\nThe guy got super upset and defensive when i asked about the freshness of the food. I assured him i would be back if the nuggets were not fresh, but he just got more upset.\n\nI get home (literally) 2 mins after i leave the place, and the nuggets are warm, and GROSS! it was like they were thrown back in the old oil to warm up after sitting there for ten minutes. Have you tasted oil that's been there longer than it should have? Or reheating something up that's already been reheated and have been stale already?\n\nWow!!!

I just visited this location because I knew their drive thru was open 24 hours a day. I pulled into the parking lot to discover that both of their drive thru lanes were blocked and not operational.

They always seem to forget my fries when I payed for a meal and/or give me the wrong sauce. Today just did it for me, after I placed my order & drove up to the window to pay, the boy didn't even greet me or confirm my total, he just simply stuck his hand out.

It is rare, but once in a blue moon, the coffee is delicious."}

It's been not working 100% of August.     \n\nLook it's not like I'm flipping out about wanting ice cream,  I don't need the calories. \n\nBut this would be my most convenient way to get a cone on the way home from work,   and I stopped in at least 10 times throughout August, each time figuring \"they must have had that shit fixed by now\" .. nope.    \n\nSo I still haven't actually had any ice cream because I'm not going to go drive around looking for it,   I just think it's dumb for a restaurant like McDonalds to not even be able to fix a machine.     This isn't some mom-and-pop shop where \"character\" is expected.    McDonalds should have their system figured out by now.   Look at all these reviews from other people they go back weeks all saying \"wtf is with the ice cream\" shit."}
{"text":"This is the most useless McDonald's I have ever seen. I've stopped by on several different occasions this year to get a McFlurry and each and every time I hear \"the machine is down\".

{"text":"McDonald's! I haven't been into a McDonald's restaurant location for years I would say.. maybe even a decade (those Walrmart McDonald's locations do not count).

This Mcdonald's location is HUGE, massive! It's right in front of the bus stop, so I'm sure they get a lot of traffic of people going on the bus! The counter is sorta placed weird, there's not much room between the counter and line up. I can see all the lines getting jumboed up during their busy hours.  \n\nAnyhoo, pretty friendly staff, clean location."}
{"text":"This location has been shut down in the past for cockroach infestation.  I've been ripped off here many times, paying for food that I don't receive and receiving unwanted items in place of those that I've ordered.  Upon complaining, the \"Manager\", who writes as if she is an uneducated teenager, tried to insist a free meal upon me rather than refund the money I paid, and then agreed to provide a refund.  Months later no refund was ever provided and follow-up emails have not been responded to. Referring this to Corporate office, as clearly there's multiple staffing issues.  This is a dirty restaurant.

{"text":"This is a really good McDonald's. I've been impressed by several of the Drive Thru workers for their politeness and efficiency, and they often throw in an extra fry or something if they've made me wait. The guys working the Drive Thru are always very sweet, and it's appreciated."}
{"text":"They are genuinely nice here. I stop here frequently, the food is always hot, and standard McDonald's fare. I see alot of students here, it is close to campus. Even if it is slammed busy, I don't have to wait long. Last time I was here, there was a man who was unreasonable and a real jerk - the menu items are quite clear about which breakfast items are offered 24/7, and he wanted something else. They handled him very politely and above the line. Wow."}
{"text":"This is one of the lesser McDonalds locations in the area, and I suppose that is because it is downtown. There are often many homeless people in here keeping warm. I have also seen dog excrement on the floor while eating. The food is usually correct but it is bad quality (sloppily put together, very cold fries, etc.). I'd pass on this location if you have the option. But, if you're a college student craving a Big Mac on campus, c'est la vie!"}
{"text":"True that this is McDonald's food, so it can only be so good. BUT, the range in McDonald's food at different McDonalds is incredible and in some cases revolting. I stop at this McDs for breakfast on my way to work when I know it's going to be a tough day. The comfort of a tasty breakfast sandwich and strangers being nice to you helps. \n\nMy food is always hot, fresh, and fast. I typically get an egg mcmuffin or a bacon egg and cheese biscuit. The morning crew is always friendly and my order has always been accurate."}

{"text":"When I write a review for McDonald's I write it based on what I expect from McDonald's. I don't expect candlelight and tablecloths; I expect a clean establishment with hot, fresh food served fast by a friendly cashier. \n\nToday, McD's is earning three stars solely for their food and value. \n\nFood was hot and fresh and, as always, a great value. \n\nBut...the cashier was not ready to work on her own; she needed more training, as she couldn't take a simple order of two combos, even though we didn't want anything special other than cream and sugar in the coffee. She had to wait for the manager to come over, which affected the speed of service, of course.\n\nNext, there was a great cozy area with a fireplace with plenty of seats. Only problems... all the tables were dirty, and the TV was blasting on full volume, even though no one was watching it."}
{"text":"After my roommates bet me I could not eat 10 doubles we took the beautiful trek to the Regent st. McDonalds. After getting into an altercation in the parking lot with a 70 year old woman about how it's not proper to cut in the drive thru line, we ordered our 10 doubles and a few other meals and went home. Burger after burger they were cooked to perfection. Seven burgers later I felt stuffed. I felt like sh** for the next two days. I think that they poisoned my food. I give it 4 Stars."}

{"text":"To the woman who ripped the \"water\" cup out of my hand because she noticed I had poured 2 ounces of sprite into my designated water cup, well, I say congratulations at being so good at your job. To the cashier who messed up my order twice and was evidently on heroin, I also applaud you for eventually getting it right (not that there's anything wrong with a little H when handling the cashier). To the corporation that passed off what they considered food but wasn't, I also applaud you for having the brass to do so.\n\nFYI, I had also already ordered a soda but I had thrown my cup away since I had just cleaned up after myself but got thirsty for more. Oops!\n\nHonestly, this place is a joke. I don't know why I went. Mickeys up the road is leaps and bounds better and cheaper for breakfast and any of the bars on Regent St. serve real burgers and chicken sandwiches or salads and you won't run into this sort of scenario at any other place that I can think of in the area. \n\nSpare your dignity and don't bother."}
{"text":"So I thought I might save a little $$ if I used the McDonald's app. I downloaded it and they give you three specials for two weeks then change it to some others.  \nStopped in with another person and we used their coupon for \"buy one specialty sandwich get one free. \nWe both ordered the grilled chicken and fries to share and a drink.\nBoth sandwiches were cold, rubbery, with little lettuce leafs and the ever infamous pale grainy tomato. \nWe threw it out.  Wrote an email to the corporate office and she asked for more details and sent us a coupon for two free specialty sandwiches. McDonalds died on the vine 10 years ago I think"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, my order was very simple. An egg mcmuffin and medium fries. I was the ONLY customer in the store. They charged me for both items, and when I got home and opened the bag, there were only fries inside. Normally, I'd glance in the bag before leaving but it was such a simple order, and since I was the only person being served...I kind of assumed there'd be no way for them to mess that up.\n\nWell shame on me, because I just came here a SECOND time, with a craving for some late-night nuggets. I got there and walked up to the door, and it was locked. There were people inside - an employee and an old man that looked to be a manager just standing around talking, and beginning to lazily take an order from the drive-thru. After 5 minutes, the manager-looking guy saw me and shook his head signalling that they were closed.\n\nI looked down at my phone to check the time. 11:37pm. They were supposed to be open until midnight. Unacceptable. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Look they have wi-fi. \nIt's on campus\n\nUsually a number of transients (can we use that word) pass through but they are safe. Hell, I'm indigent and I'm safe. lol\n\nApparently the fire place isn't working and how did I learn this? Well today, of all days, as I tried to study... a women with 3 bad & wild boys came in. Ok, the previous kids that passed through were behaved maybe these blondies can hold it together. ERGGH NO! Then a wife & husband couple come through with even more kids! I am forced to look up because 1 bugger decided to jump into a seat...at my table no less! \n\nThe kids are whooting and hollering. Fighting, being rambunctious. And I'm writing all of this because (1) it made me realize do any Mickey D's have a play area anymore? I know some do because some child was just assaulted at one, (2) Why don't these folks train their kids, (3) are they lost, (4) if the Yelpers wrote about bad kids at Chuck E Cheese and they are expected to be there maybe I should write about the kids at this location so it won't shock the system of the next patron. \n\nBut the dad said something 1x to all the kids to keep it down. Then the women chimed in with useless words......Then 20minutes later dad said, \"I have to go outside. I have steam coming out of my ears.\" This made me further question...whatever happened to Men being Dads? Instead of running from your loud, rude, rowdy, Jethro & Emily mae 'restling kids..Do something. So it made me wonder was he trying to signal me or secretly meet some dude in the bathroom after tapping his feet?\n\nIn the end, my battery was dying and I couldn't take much more. Look the kids don't bother me as much as lack of parenting.  Oh, back to my original item, I learned the fireplace wasn't' working because \"dad\" decided to try and fix it. When an elderly regular told him they can't get a part in. Well.. I guess this is all in a day of hanging out at your local Mickey D's."}

{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would. Employees were mean and disrespectful. Building was dirty. They have a late night menu from midnight to 4:00 am that has very limited selection aka no McDoubles. Oh and they don't accept credit cards at this time and don't tell you until you reach the window."}
{"text":"The employees here are probably the crabbiest I've ever seen at any McDonald's. It's happened almost every time I've been there. Tonight the guy at the window opened it and gave the food and slammed it shut without saying anything. I didn't know if I had gotten all my food yet or what? Anyways I'm tired of how rude they are. Something needs to be done!"}
{"text":"It's a McDonald's not much else to say.  Near the capital fairly clean that's about all."}
{"text":"I wished I could give this zero star. The lady at the window where you get the food from was rude. The food, omg. Eating the fries was like eating a salt lick, an old and soggy one. At first I thought the cheeseburger was okay....well about an hour or 2 later, I felt sick to my stomach and guess what?! I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning from eating here because I puked up everything I ate from here. \nThanks McDonald's at regent st, for making me feel like shit and for having employees who don't give a damn."}
{"text":"Most McDonald's have a little jar by the till that you can put change in to help charities. This one cuts out the middle man and has homeless people actually come to your table to ask for change, such a convenient touch. \nAlso really good Chicken Nuggets. Try them with sauce."}
{"text":"You know what -- I admit it -- I do like some things on their menu.  Especially for breakfast.\n\nBut this location even manages to screw that up.  I order a medium latte and a sausage and egg biscuit (not the combo).\n\nThe coffee comes and I wait and wait and wait.\nFinally they ask me if I want anything else.\nDUH!  How about the sandwich I ordered??!!!!!\nOops, can't find the bill - some over-zealous counter wench threw it away (which I brought to her attention when she did it and she ignored me)!!!\n\nSo they get me the sandwich (JUST a REMINDER - ALWAYS ALWAYS check your order).\n\nSo I don't (I was in a hurry) -- but part way up the street I decide to and YEP you guessed it -- totally wrong order).\n\nSo I go back and tell them, and they hurriedly get  me a new one -- and the rude server did not apologize (although her boss did).  But nothing for my inconvenience - I mean they could have given me a coupon or something.\n\nGet real McDonalds!  You want people to come back - you better step up with the service!\n\nI have to STOP going to this Mc-e-dees!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a bit shady downstairs. But if you're planning on eating in, it might be a good idea to go upstairs. It's a lot cleaner and not as shady. Washrooms are ok."}
{"text":"Needed a quick fix for the kids who were getting hangry.  Two happy meals later they seemed to calm down a bit.  The layout of this Micky D's is terrible packed like sardines when entering the line is chaotic with little to no room for a double stroller.  Also had to hoof it up stairs and carry everyone up the narrow staircase for seating.  This place was dirty...like NYC dirty."}
{"text":"I visited to use the clean washroom and stayed for a coffee break.  The staff is quick and within a minute after placing my order I had my order.\nThe staff is always waking around tidying/clearing  the tables and sweeping the floors."}
{"text":"To be honest, they only thing I have ever ordered here was free coffee in the morning (so slow but it was free so I have to have understanding even if it made me a bit late for work!) and ice cream on a summer evening (cheap and delicious and satisfying). The entire restaurant is never very clean and from my few experiences, the service is slow- but hey, it's mcdonalds and they give out free coffee sometimes! JOY!"}
{"text":"This McDonalds is in a fantastic location, but is filled with oddballs at all times of the day. I really respect the people who work at this location, because I can only imagine how much they have to put up with.\n\nIt's a popular spot after hours, when people are leaving bars and clubs. \n\nUnless I'm REALLY craving McDonald's, I would avoid this location. I recommend going a few steps further and grabbing Banh Mi Boys!"}
{"text":"I like coming here for a drink or coffee and to charge up my phone a bit. It's a nice place but it sometimes smells because of the people in the area who obviously don't wash themselves. The staff work hard to keep it as clean as they can and the service is fast but they can't control everything. Sometimes beggars will come in and try to get money or sell stuff. Wifi almost never works but there are lots of outlets around to charge your devices if you can get a seat. It's a small place and gets packed some days. There's a TV upstairs that plays a low quality muted version of CP24 and occasionally a foreign business news channel. Surprisingly the TV. Hasn't been stolen and sold for drugs yet. Still one of my favorite places to grab a soda and stay for a short while, make sure to sit upstairs if you can! Washrooms are generally clean but the sink is weird looking and there is no mirror. The place could use some air freshener, bring your own perfume or cologne for good measure."}
{"text":"This McDonald's definitely lives up to the name of fast FOOD, because when it comes to drinks, their staff is slower than a turtle. coffees, iced drinks take approximately ten mins. I can have my mcmuffin and hash brown ready.. but i am waiting with the rest of the coffee drinkers for their uber slow service. Don't go if you are in a rush to get to work.. But also don't go if u don't want to put up with the snotty service (yeah, i know! it's McD!)"}
{"text":"This is my favourite McDick's location in the city. \n\nIt was near my old office, and I often indulged in the sausage and egg McMuffin combo. Most get with coffee or OJ, but I'm partial to their tiny apple juices. They look like urine samples which is gross, but AJ is a cure all. \n\nMornings at this location are made extra good by a girl who works there named Princess. Yes, that is her real name and she is the funniest and most efficient McDonald's employee in the history of the world. She holds it down hard.\n\nAt nighttime this location is particularly scary with floods of drunk and high people, but who doesn't enjoy a cornucopia of characters? I know I do. \n\nMan, now I'm craving McDonald's. \n\nPEPPER POINTS: For hiring my girl Princess.\n\n9/30"}
{"text":"this location goes above and beyond every single time I come here, either solo or with a group of friends. this two level location that virtually is always open never fails to impress me with the level of service and food that they put out *yes I know its Mcds, don't knock it* this location is abundant with transit options as it is on the corner of queen and spadina, routes 501 queen and 510 spadina offer service to this location. parking is not really an option, YES street parking is available but good luck getting it, there are quite a few underground lots in the area though. lots of seating at this location with the two floors. \nmy only negative gripe about this location is the customers who come into this location, most of them are over the top in being rude, which is completely uncalled for."}
{"text":"If you've ever wanted to struggle through a Quarter Pounder while choking on the inescapable scent of hobo pee, boy, do I have the place for you!\n\nLook, I'm not saying I go to McDonald's expecting to have a good experience.  I don't go to McDonald's because it's good, period; I go because it's *consistent*.  It's *CONSISTENTLY* bad.  Beyond the twice-a-year Big Mac cravings we all shamefully experience, I only wind up at a McDonald's because I have no other choice, and I resign myself to it because I feel I generally understand the depths to which I'm going to sink.  I eat at McDonalds in airports, and cities in which I am lost and starving, where being indoors late at night is recommended for safety.  Think Detroit.  Don't get me wrong, I'd give the average McDonald's an average 3 stars, maybe 4 stars if it was really nicely appointed.  You don't judge McDonald's locations on anything but their own exclusive scale, and I'm cool with that.\n\nBut sadly that's not the case here.  As you may've noticed, my review is one star, which is frankly one star too many for this particular McDonald's location.  I wound up here because after I got my order across the street at Burger's Priest, I couldn't find a seat because the place was crowded with entitled hipsters taking up chairs despite not having their food yet.  Struck with a moment of inspiration and convinced I was a genius, I decided to grab a seat at this McDonald's mere steps away, justifying my existence there with the purchase of a Coke and some fries.  It was the perfect plan; I'd have the free refills so callously disregarded at the Priest, and I'd eat my burger with plenty of elbow room to spare.\n\nThat was the plan.\n\nUnfortunately on this particular occasion, the upstairs floor of the McDonald's was closed \"due to flooding.\"  I wasn't sure what kind of flood would close the second floor of an establishment without closing the ground floor, but whatever.  I got my Coke, my fries, and grabbed a seat by the window.  Tearing into my Priest burger it hit me; a wave of odour so disgusting it was barely fended off by the shield of aroma from my Bacon Cheeseburger with Smoke.  As long as I kept the burger within six inches of my face, and my mouth full of house-ground beef and melted cheese, I was fine momentarily.  Thus, I survived for the brief term of my meal.  But moments after the burger was over and done with, the surroundings overtook me and I fought to control the urge to hurl my body through the plate glass and straight onto Spadina in an effort to escape.  It was awful.  It was the worst thing.  I'm convinced the \"flooding\" upstairs was some concerted effort by wild local animals to mark their territory, by urinating *everywhere*.\n\nIf you've seen a few movies in theaters lately you might have watched a particular commercial running before the trailers.  In it, a man and a woman meet for the first time, and in a nod to Linklater's \"Before Sunrise\" they wander the streets of Toronto, engaging in a conversation neither wishes to end.  Confronted by closing storefronts and the impending 2 AM last call, they take refuge in a McDonald's, ending in a tableau where the two of them share a view of the sunrise from the second floor of a 24-hour McDonald's.  The McDonald's in that commercial is THIS McDonald's, the couple sharing their late night dialogue while enjoying the view of the city from the closed-to-me-due-to-dubious-flooding second floor.  And I feel that as ghetto-adorable as that commercial is, it should end with a notice of caveat.\n\nThis McDonald's is not a place where romances go to begin, nor to thrive.  This McDonald's is where romances go to destroy themselves, one urine-scented moment of heartbreak at a time.  No love has ever grown here.  Nothing, in fact, has ever grown here.  Plants wilt.  Children become stunted.\n\nDon't believe the commercial.  This place is hell with french fries, and it is where love goes to die."}
{"text":"At 6am this McD's is open. And it's the first place selling coffee that I found wandering east on Queen St. after realizing I was out of coffee at home. Along with the late night crowd, this beacon of familiarity is a magnet for international tourists and anyone from around Toronto not familiar with the independents and just want comfort food that will taste just like any other McD's on the planet. The staff move at a placid place, unmoved by their obviously cosmo surroundings knowing that they are in an island paradise where you can get a coffee and a free muffin for under $2. This morning, they seemed a little stunned, and barely following thru with orders from customers repeated and repeated again just to make sure and there could be less delays. Ah McD's, carry on!"}
{"text":"Weird layout, always busy and the people waiting to pick up food stand around the order queue so you never know who's next. Also I'm no food snob but grey chicken, seriously?! Over sauced and poor quality meat."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy my meal as I was harassed my homeless people for food and my burger was dry and over cooked. Also tables and condiments areas not clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of McDonalds or any fast food joint for that matter but this place does have great specialty coffees. Service is generally pretty fast here too and in all fairness the staff here work in a very stressful location.\n\nThe 2nd floor has a great view of Spadina and there is free wifi. They should try and make more of an effort to keep the bathrooms clean though.\n\nI can't comment on the food here because I have never ordered food here, but as I mentioned they have a great selection of coffees (cold and iced) at prices much better than Tim's or Starbucks."}
{"text":"Absolute dump. Filthy and was solicited for change while eating. Don't bring loved ones anywhere near here."}
{"text":"For a Mc Donalds this place used to be way worse before. After the renovation they managed to keep most of the homeless out that were actively using and fighting in the dining area. Management has also worked on some service issues which really does stand out here.\n\nThe place now sees so much foot traffic that the upstairs is usually full of messy tables, even though they clean it every 15-20 min. Food quality is really high compared to the others though, I don't think I've ever had an item were toppings were scattered everywhere like most of the other Mc Donald's these days. The manager here is real decent, all problems fixed in a few min, just let them know if theres something you have an issue with."}
{"text":"Ah, McDonalds, how you suck! However, this location isn't so bad because of the late hours so we can visit after the bar.\n\nThis review is for the fun times I've had in this location - especially nights after the Cameron House!\n\nSometimes there's live entertainment - courtesy of common drunkenness. Good times - especially after 2:00am!\n\nThe food still sucks! Four stars for the entertainment only!"}
{"text":"Its a super busy McDonald's, the staff works hard and have to deal with stabbings and other sketch people. Lots of respect to these hard working people just trying to get by in life. Still...its McDonald's. 10 outta 10 service but the food sucks"}
{"text":"For a counter that is ceaslessly pummelled with a steady rotation of drug- and/or booze-addled louts, the McCrew at the Queen and Spads McDick's are surprisingly mild-tempered and serene. Perhaps exposure to the revolving door of skids that traipse through this place has made the staff apathetic and numb. Or maybe they are customers of the shaky guy in the leather pants with a literal pocketful of prescription downers. I wonder if MacDonald's gets corporate rate?\n\nThis 24 hour dealie peaks right around last call, where you will no doubt encounter the wobbliest people in the the city. I was once asked by a probably-not-even-that-drunk Nigerian if I \"like to dance.... to music.\" Buried in the liminal space betwen 'dance' and 'to music' is everything you need to know about this shack of drunken insanity and their ersatz-eats.\n\nI highly recommend nothing on their menu, but what do you care, you're already wasted. If nothing else you'll walk out of here with your senses molested and 15,000 calories in a greasy bag. (And what the **** is a McDouble?)\n\nObligatory Title Pun: McDon't.\n\nMenu Readability: Sang the menu: \"If you don't know me by know...\"\n\nNeed to mention: This place sucks, but it's open late.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: I actually do prefer music when dancing."}
{"text":"This location has been reno'd so it's now the McCafe concept. Other than that it's still the hub of drunken post-bar debauchery that it always has been.\n\nOne night as I was stumbling home I stopped in to get a Big Mac combo. When I received my order I found that they had decided for that I wanted it upsized and had charged me for it with out asking. Because I was a good deal into the bottle I decided to keep my mouth shut instead of making a scene and ending up in the drunk tank.\n\nMy trip here last week revealed that the staff don't have patience. They call out your order when they bring it up to the counter. Before you even have a chance to make eye contact with the person holding the bag (pun intended), they're calling a second time.\n\n\nOh and to answer your question Vivek, a McDouble is a bun filled with regret and remorse.\n\nNov. 30-day challenge 18/30."}
{"text":"Why is it no matter how busy this location is, the burgers are always old? I almost never get freshly cooked meat, and the same goes for the chicken nuggets I bought the other day! It's really disappointing, because otherwise I like this location. The fries are usually fresh, the employees are fast, and the place is usually clean. You'd think since this location has such high competition, that they wouldn't be taking their customers for granted. If you want a good McDs experience, the location at Yonge near Wellesley is always hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I like the location of this McDonald's, right in the heart of a busy downtown area. In saying this, I would have liked it if it was bigger inside, when i walked in, it was unbelievably cramped......the use of the squiggly line up was very useful! \nI didn't have to wait too long for my order despite how packed it was. There's not much seating on the first floor, but they have a staircase leading to an upper level with a good amount of tables, and a TV. I sat up there to devour my meal, and really enjoyed the view....its nice to be elevated a story! The thing I disliked was that there were some shady characters, but you can't blame the company for that."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is about the worst. And that says a lot. Everyone is unfriendly the fries are never full. Ketchup?  Forget it. Management argues about their mistakes.  I'd start with the district manager and fire him and work my way down. Obviously he doesn't care. Go anywhere else"}
{"text":"I just grabbed two burgers and a fry to go. I got home .3 miles away and my fry's were limp and room temp and the buns look like they are at least a month old to the point that I lost my appetite and  tossed them in the garbage."}
{"text":"I drove through the drive through early one morning to get my coffer fix. I decided to try their iced coffee as I have recently been in the mood to find the best iced coffee around.  The service was quick and my coffee was tasty.  No complaints."}
{"text":"The fries were solid as usually, but I thought that my mcnuggets tasted a little off and underdone.  They weren't as crispy as they should've been."}
{"text":"This place is as bad as Burger King. During my last visit I could notice that most of the tables and chairs were wobbly. Besides, I found chewing gum under the table. I do like chewing gum but not when is old and has been aging for years."}
{"text":"I've come here several times for lunch and it's never busy.  I like it because it's clean, has plenty of seats, and the employees are nice.  I rarely dine inside of a McDonald's, but every once in a while, I will get a Big Mac Attack and come inside to take care of it.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdonalds-scottsdale-8?select=4qc_FPKhJYUNJ6yTJmc0xQ#4qc_FPKhJYUNJ6yTJmc0xQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdonalds-scottsdale-8?select=GTHNeWe4bo06DkZtEg6Sfg#GTHNeWe4bo06DkZtEg6Sfg\n\nI've also tried their new Angus Bacon Burger.  It's not bad.  The Bacon is the super thin kind, which I don't really care for, but the Beef is better than their regular Burgers.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdonalds-scottsdale-8?select=XTgR8kBOQSGBsQ0b0HtR8w#XTgR8kBOQSGBsQ0b0HtR8w\n\nOverall, this location is OK for a Mickey D's.\n\nReturn Factor - 50%"}
{"text":"Called several times over the years PLEASE TAKE DOWN THE TORN AND TATTERED AMERICAN FLAG PLEASE They seem not to understand that the American flag cannot be flown when it's rip tattered for dirty ass them all the time to take it down and they don't they need to remove the flag"}
{"text":"This location is never too busy, clean, staff is friendly, and quick. Here is my synapsis on the current state of McDonalds. \n\nMcCaf√© and Breakfast: I went to Starbucks today and paid $6.43 for a Latte and muffin and it wasn't that great. I would much rather have a Vanilla Iced Coffee and Egg McMuffin from McDonalds, it's always tasty and consistent.\n\nMcRib: Rib Meat shapened into a Rib Bear Claw is awesome, I don't care what you aristocrat haters think.\n\nSalads: Buying a salad from McDonalds is like going to a Mexican restaurant and ordering a cheeseburger. Besides, I don't think I trust salad from a giant fast food corporation.\n\nSnack Wrap: A satisfying 'in between' meal.\n\nBurgers: Kinda weird burger meat, but unique, kinda good."}
{"text":"McDonald's is just McDonald's.\nI love that they have all day breakfast now and the new Mcpick $2 Menu is a nice addition.\nI think they have introduced that instead of the $1 menu that they previously had.\nThey have some new additions like Mozzarella sticks and Mcchicken in their $2 menu.\n\nI'm more a drive thru kind of person and this location does a pretty decent job.The service is fast.I also like their Iced caramel Mocha with whole milk.And we all love their world famous fries(even if it's killing us).\n\nCheers!"}
{"text":"I don't understand anyone of the other people that rated this McDonalds...  How do you say all nice things and then rate it a 3/5??  I get that it is a McDonalds and that we all know it isn't the healthiest of places, but at least rate the location based on the individual experience that you had there.\n\nAs for my visit, it was great this time, just as it always has been.  I have been both inside and out and the place is always clean, the staff is always happy and friendly and the wifi is always fast.  This is definitely one of the best McDonalds in the Valley!  Where else can you go get a large soda for $1?  Not a QT or even a Walgreens, this is the place."}
{"text":"Okay, so lately, I've been eating McDonald's more than I should (for breakfast).\n\nThis one is the closest one to my house and it's just fine. I mostly go through the drive-thru, and they're pretty quick with orders. When I do go inside it seems clean. The workers all/mostly seem competent enough. Honestly, I remember this McDonald's used to have the most incompetent workers some years ago. Like, to the point where I'd avoid coming here, even when I wanted McDonald's (who does that?). Glad to see things have improved..."}
{"text":"I know you shouldn't expect much coming here but at least expect to eat in a clean environment and that place is disgusting and this has nothing to do with food, so no excuses !!!"}
{"text":"Nice for a McDonald's - I enjoy that they have some cushy chairs!"}
{"text":"The inside of this Mcdonalds is clean overall, but it doesn't look as nice as other McDonalds due to no renovations for several years.  Due to no renovations, it doesn't look that clean, but it is.  They should update their booths because there is no cushioning and it's connected to the other person behind you.  That means when the person behind me kept on standing up to get more condiments or a refill, I could feel my seat jerk and it was very annoying.  They have a separate play area for children that they keep separate for those who don't have kids which is great.  The only thing I really like from Mcdonalds is the McNuggets, Ice cream, yogurt parfait, and fries.  However, when I am finished, I never feel good (ha, it's fast food!).  Last time I went, I felt they were unsanitary.  The girl who took my money, used the same hands to get my ice cream cone and was touching the cone part.  I ate it anyways, but who knows as a cashier how many earlier bills she touched.   I always feel a little unsafe here sometimes at night because the Walgreens next store never seems to kick off the homeless people."}
{"text":"I understand this is a McDonalds but seriously... Let's see flies everywhere inside... None of their fountain drinks work. I told them. Came back to see if fixed and they were asking me again what was wrong. Let's see none of them work. They all taste horrible.. The salad I got was wilted and slimy. Kids cheeseburger looked nasty son said the chicken nuggets tasted a little hard. They forgot my sons apple juice and had to ask them for the cup for my other son... I will definitely not be coming back here again... Absolutely disgusted!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here multiple times while moving furniture. Cold drink, $1. Don't have to get out of car. No one begged for money in the drive thru line. A perfect execution of beverage."}
{"text":"Only mcdonalds i have been to that has spicy chicken sandwich for 99cents. amazing even though Mcdonalds in general is a 1 star place i loved spicy chicken sandwich. Must be high concentration of mexicans that they feel need to spice everything up or that is at least my brother who lives in Scotsdale says. He is puerto rican and asked if he is asked if he is mexican daily lol gotta love arizona. I would totally take my girl here for a romantic and intimate dinner of spicy chicken sandwiches"}
{"text":"Fairly decent location.\nWeird setup but I guess that's just the way they do things these days.  Compact front of the house where you place your order.  It's like the soda fountains are right behind you.  If you get out of line and there's someone behind you waiting to order you will probably have to excuse yourelf to gain access to the soda fountain.\nThe dining area didn't seem very big, in fact it almost seemed to be drawfed by the childrens play area.\nWhy?!"}
{"text":"I am shocked right now. I just witnessed what appeared to be the manager, be completely rude to an elderly couple. The woman is lucky I'm in my work uniform. It made me so mad I just walked out. And will definitely never return to this McDonald's. Something needs to be done that was completely uncalled for."}
{"text":"McDonald's serves its purpose, A quick junk bite for on the fly. I love the deals on the app until...\n\n\nWhat purpose is the mobile app offering B1G1 breakfast sandwiches if your also running a 2 for $4 promotion? So after I buy my 2 sausage,egg and biscuit sandwiches the total is 5.02. I get to the window and scan the app and no discount. As the employee calls the manager he told me about the 2 for $4. The bottom line is the app is just a sucker deal. Disgruntled"}
{"text":"To start off, GO IN AND ORDER.\n\nI have went through the drive through multiple times and have gotten my ordered screwed up-and it isn't only this mcdonalds. \n\nBut here's a story about this drive thru that made me laugh more than upset ( this happened to me): I ordered a premium grilled chicken sandwich, without cheese of course. We pulled up, paid then awaited at the next window for our food. We got it and everything was there. I opened my box to eat my food because I was so hungry. I checked for cheese and you won't believe it....they forgot the chicken on my chicken sandwich! I laughed for awhile and couldn't believe it- I went back and they were shocked as well- but I got a new sandwich-chicken INCLUDED this time. \n\nJust don't go through the drive thru, it's best to go in."}
{"text":"This has to be the absolute WORST Mcdonalds!! As I walked in a guy was walking out just looked at me and said Goodluck you'll need it!  Then i stood in front of the register for 10 minutes as the staff seemed to try to not make eye contact with me. From there one of the managers friends I'm assuming with the way they spoke to each other walked in they gave her 3 bags of food and she left.. Finally I said something ordered a burger with no onion (keep in mind I'm the ONLY person in there) after another 10 minutes I get it... It has onions... Took another 5 minutes to get someone to acknowledge that I'm still standing there I inform them that it isn't correct after waiting 7 minutes for them to remake it I said nevermind I'm done I just want my money back... I called the store to get there franchise corporate number called them and they assured someone would call me to follow up.. Never heard anything. And by the looks of the other reviews without any responses they could careless.. At this point I'm not sure even calling McDonald's corporate offices would help at all."}
{"text":"Ok, don't go here late at night and give an order through the drive-through.  They messed up our order completely and what we did get was cold.  We were in a hurry to go home or we would have returned to get our food fixed (and probably spit in).  We were not happy at all."}
{"text":"It would be nice if the people at the drive in were not trained to hand you your food and run away without giving you a chance to ask for ketchup. Otherwise nice location but the customer service needs improvement, at least ask people if they want it."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but McDonald's is the ultimate American comfort food! I'm not going to comment on the disparity of different McDonald's experiences and locations...Our typical order (regardless of where we get our Micky D's): RAW gets a double quarter pounder with cheese, large fries and a large Coke, me a plain double cheeseburger, small fries and a small Coke...and we share a ten piece Mc Nuggets with sweet n' sour. The bad news...I'm not having Mc Donald's again until I lose the ten pounds I've gained eating it while moving from Sacramento to Vegas. Yikes!"}
{"text":"Ugh, this McD's has gone so far downhill. It was actually impressed there for awhile at how quickly and efficiently the drive-thru process was. At one point, they even gave you a little timer and aimed to have you completely through before the hourglass ran out. But then it took a massive dive. While they have brought back the hot mustard sauce (yay!!), the amount of time it takes to get through the drive-thru has increased at least 5x. I have literally spent over 15 minutes at this drive-thru. 15 mins! And every time I've gone recently, my food has been cold by the time I get it. So it's been sitting there for awhile. Ick! Save yourself the hassle and just go inside to get your order. I don't know what on earth has happened here."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service. Too many flies inside the restaurant! Needs to be taken care of."}
{"text":"very friendly staff, i complained about how they messed up my order at the other Mcdonald, the staff replaced my order here at no charge! wow"}
{"text":"How difficult is it to just put what was ordered, in the bag? It's not like it's a one-time occurance either. You want $15/Hr and you cannot handle the simplest of tasks? What a joke!"}
{"text":"What can I say about good ol' McDonalds.\n\nMorning & Late night orderings lines do get pretty long.  Especially since its near the freeway so it gets pretty hectic. \n\nHad there big breakfast & oatmeal several times and the oatmeal is pretty dry! I wish they put a little more milk or something in there.\nAlso, i tried the dipped cone & was not good. \n\nBut McDonalds fries are never a disappointment :)"}
{"text":"I know McDonald's isn't the most health-conscious, but you know as well as I do that it is THE BEST place to get a Coca-Cola! McDonald's' Coke mix is by far THE BEST of any place I've ever been and their consistency with that taste is what keeps brining me back when I'm looking for a quick drink. Add a large fry with a little salt and I'm in heaven!\n\nThe service has always been exceptional at this location although it does get a lot of transients. The staff is always friendly, greeting you with a smile, and taking care of business."}
{"text":"So, very hot day in vegas... well, compared to Mountain View, CA that is... I had some scrap steel I wanted to sell, and had just carried a load to my local recycler... and  I was thirsty.... My wife and I decided to swing by McD to get our favorite Wild Berry Smoothie and went to the drive thru.\n\nThe drive thru at this McD is unusual in that there is actually a live person at a window (they have 3 windows, one to order, one to pay, and one to get food) taking orders. Before I said anything, he's like, \"would you like to try our new mango pineapple smoothie?\"... I said, \"well, I was going to order our favorite, wild berry smoothie..\" He says, \"the Mango Pinapple is much better.... you can put Baccari's in there and it would make a great frozen drink too\"  Sold!\n\nIt was good! The syrupy sweetness of mango with the sweet tang of pineapple was very refreshing on this hot Vegas day... it just might become my new favorite."}
{"text":"I wanted to take off a star for the weird bendy line that I always have to wait in when I go through the drive thru. However, the truth is that if I simply parked my car and walked my lazy a** inside, I would not have to wait.\n\nSpeaking of their drive thru, wow. You could be in a line all the way out to Eastern and you would be through that line in 5 minutes. They really have an operation going on there. This is what happens when you have the budget to hire sufficient amounts of employees.\n\nOne time this one girl was kinda mean to me...but I can't blame McDonalds.  It felt like an anger caused by something such as a breakup or a stressful issue with not paying rent, so I let it go.\n\nHAVE YOU HAD THEIR FRIES?!?!!?  I don't care what people say. I think are putting crack in those. Salt and crack. If one day down the line we find out that McDonalds fries were so good because they were laced with something, I won't be shocked."}
{"text":"All McDonalds are created equal, right? Nope! Food was we expected but service was horrible. I placed my order for myself and 2 kids. Picked up my order and went to my table. My son wanted extra condiments so I went the the pick-up area and the manager served three people and she disregarded my attempts to get her attention. I finally got what I needed and went back to table. My son again wanted some extra syrup so I went k ask and she rilled her eyes and handed me syrup saying \"if you want something, just ask fr it when u order and it will be on your tray\" and walked away...  Rude!"}
{"text":"Great live drive thru.  Preferable to reciting order into an impersonal box.  Good staff and order accuracy as well. Also, location location location. It is a very easy in and out on the way to anywhere."}
{"text":"So Happy I randomly came to this mc Donalds before my shift!! Every one I go to never seems to have expresso shots for their iced coffees! && to my surprise this one did!!! So happy! Not to mention all their new hires at every window did a good job ."}
{"text":"Ok let's not talk about the food. We all know it's bad for you and evil, whatever. What I like about this particular McDonald's is the face to face drive through!  I love not yelling into a speaker and hoping they heard me correctly. It's so refreshing to just talk to someone face to face. I haven't been here a lot, but I can say I've had no errors in my food - quite impressive."}
{"text":"I was impressed by the staff's friendliness! They got my order wrong once, but they were so kind and quick to correct the issue that I was actually happy! I was really impressed by the food quality and fast service! I really enjoy coming here. They haven't gotten my order wrong since!! Great service and food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  No complaints.  I can't believe how busy the drive through at this place always is.  They must be one of the top grossing McDonald's in Vegas."}
{"text":"This tasty Bacon Clubhouse Burger had a perfect zing of flavor that popped right after the first bite, and sent my taste buds on a first class trip to party city. As the box says, 'the different ingredients \"mingle\" on an artisan roll', and they form a flawless blend that puts a smile on your face. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone, as I find it is one of the most scrumptious things on McDonalds menu. They also provided fast, friendly, and accurate customer service. Definitely the best Mcdonalds out there!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this McDonald's for 8 years. Service both through the lobby and drive thru are always sopt on. The food is consistent at peak rush times, however non-peak hours the food is horrible. French fries are gummy and soft and the new buttermilk chicken sandwich is over fried, dry, hard and the bread is like two pieces of bark. On the average if you want fresh anything, ask for the fries fresh off the grill and make sure you custom make your sandwich (i.e., no ketchup or pickles or add extra) it's a little bit of a wait, but worth it."}
{"text":"Does McDonald's really need a review?\n\nIt's hot outside, so it's a perfect place to grab a cheap drink. I also like their McCafe coffees.\n\nFood obviously less than mediocre, but we all love the dollar menu.\n\nLine was horrendous around 1:00pm."}
{"text":"Uuuughhhhhgg!!! I asked for mild sauce with my burritos, i asked for buffalo sauce with my chicken, i NEED katsup for my fries!!! He said \" no problem\". I have no sauces that i asked for,  not a single packet of anything! ! I have dry fries, sad fries. What is the DEAL!! WHY!! iam so angry,  just spent 28$ on dinner,  and now i can't eat it . I HATE MCDONALD'S"}
{"text":"August 6, 2016. 7:10am. Drive thru, clerk KS#13 K'S order 42. Total of check was $3.87, I tendered a twenty dollar bill, received $16.10 change with explanation, \"we are out of pennies so your change is 3 cents short.\" Really. This is not the first instance that I have been intentionally short changed by a server/counter person. The point here is the bad practice, not the amount of the shortage. The manager came to the window and confirmed this is their standard practice. I got my three cents and probably a ban from that McDonald's."}
{"text":"What happens when you have 3 people doing 1 job?? You get this idiocracy!\nPulled up here to get a \"quick breakfast\" to go and i was just irritated out othere beyond belief.\n\nFirst: you have to pull up to one employee who takes your order face to face ( rang me up at $4.73,) then u pull up to another window where u have to 2nd window where jerk tells u first window is an idiot and price is now $ 6.93.\n\nSecond window wants you to pay higher price before going to 3rd window to collect \"fast food\". \n\n2nd window gets supervisor who wastes more time and sticks to new higher  price."}
{"text":"Ate here during my lunch break before I had to head over to St. Rose (Siena) Hospital across the street. I've eaten here a few times before.\n\nIt's a McDonald's. There's not really much else to say. I ordered my typical fast food meal: a Spicy McChicken and medium fries for a grand total of $3.02.\n\nIt was pretty crowded, but I managed to snag a small table meant for two. I guess other people were on their lunch breaks as well. Service was good and fast despite being so busy.\n\nKetchup is also available in packets in the area where salt, pepper, and napkins are also available. This is a plus since other places require you to ask for ketchup.  If you're feeling mischievous aka cheap, you can bring some home in your to-go bag.\n\nAdequate parking and right across the street from the hospital. While there's nothing extraordinary about the place, it serves its purpose in serving cheap and easy fast food.  I'll definitely come back if I feel the need for such a meal when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I give this McDonald's 5 stars comparing it to other McDonalds restaurants in the Las Vegas/ Henderson area. service is fast whether you're in the drive-thru or ordering inside.."}
{"text":"very fast and friendly, clean and courteous, considering how busy they are on black friday"}
{"text":"If we go to Chipotle a little further down, we will hit this on the way back for $1 drinks.  Bargain dinner FTW.  Food is always correct when I order it and all the people that I've encountered there are pleasant.\n\nI've been inside the restaurant itself once and it's nice & clean.  Most of the time I go through the drive-thru and always receive prompt service.  Easy in/out driveway which is a HUGE plus for me; enter from Eastern, exit onto St. Rose.  Wham, bam, thank you ma'am."}
{"text":"Waited 43 minutes to get my food.I order 2 sausage egg mcmuffins.Just got home and no egg.Really pathetic.Id wait for food If they would make it hot and the right order.Thanks for ruining my morning"}
{"text":"This review is for their drive-thru service. Came here around 2 AM and there was a long line. We even hesitated a bit about waiting in the line but I'm glad we chose to stay because the service was fast... I think we waited about 5 mins. \n\nThe one thing I like about this location is that you can get a parfait at 2 AM while most other McDonalds are out of parfaits at that time."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! The guy could not get our order right and then overcharged us. Then gave us the receipt and exclaimed, :If there's a problem take it up with my manager at the next window!\" He was very rud! Then the non-English-speaking manager came over and we told her to cancel our order and it took her several minutes to do so, but only after asking us what we wanted to do. Then they short changed us! And you want $15 per hour? GOOD LUCK WITH THAT!!!"}
{"text":"It's McDonalds that should say a lot. I really don't like the way their drive thru works... Why cant I just order at the board? It would be so much easier if you had the menu in front of you to double check what the guy at the window is saying... It's not like they were going to getting right anyway. I do give McD's credit for having great ice cream! I don't know why but I have always loved their cones... It's really the only edible thing there."}
{"text":"Idiots. Screwed up all three items. Left the tarter off my filet. Gave me pickles. 15 minute drive thru time Eff this location."}
{"text":"Went here with my son this past weekend...haven't been to this location in a while and sure enough nothing has changed.  Seriously, I don't know why I even dare take him to another location...oh I remember why...because this one doesn't have a play area :(.  However, taking him somewhere where he gets the slightest distraction from eating his entire meal makes for an unhappy mommy because he ends up not eating his food.\n\nThis location is CLEAN and NOT attached to a gas station (which I always thought was weird).  They even have fresh flowers on every table.  The drive thru is always busy; however if you go in it will save you time.  The staff are efficient...once you get their attention because they seem to be a bit chatty with one another.  The food was as good as it gets for a fast food joint and especially a McDonalds.  My son got a 4 piece chicken nugget Happy Meal and the fries were fresh from the fryer and was not just sitting under the heat lamp.  They were also not stingy with the BBQ sauce like most places and didn't charge us for an extra one as you only get 1 for a happy meal.\n\nWill definitely be coming back here again when there's a good toy out..."}
{"text":"Simple order oatmeal with brown sugar and hot tea with two Splenda and two creams \nWhat I received \nOatmeal with fruit in it already \nHot water no tea bag no cram no sugar \nLovely"}
{"text":"Clean.  Friendly.  Great customer service.  fast."}
{"text":"Free wifi saved my butt when mine at home froze up! And I was there late enough to get a free apple pie that someone ordered but never picked up!"}
{"text":"We frequent this location as it is in our office buildings parking lot. This is a super busy [maybe one of the busiest locations I have ever been to!]; the drive-thru moves quickly and the service is always great and everyone is always very friendly."}
{"text":"Went here after a soccer game for lunch around 1PM and it was crazy in the parking lot making it hard to find a spot.  Once in we placed our order but going to a McDonalds drive through or not I always get pickles and onions when I ask for them not to put any on.  Maybe I speak softly or maybe I am speaking in a different language.  I didn't even go back to get a new one since the line was so long. But, I have to say this location is very clean.  They always have someone cleaning up inside and outside the location.  No kid area but after a great game of soccer my daughter just needed to worry about her lunch.  We would go back again and maybe I will just order something else that doesn't have onions or pickles say a salad which would be good for my hips."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The service has been real good here. Until tonight. There was a totally different crew there tonight. I understand that things may have been crazy there tonight because they were only able to take cash. Still yet, if you make a mistake own up to it and make it right. I don't like writing these kinds of reviews because I like to be fair. Tonight though, they really disappointed me. I called the restaurant after I got home and spoke to a manager named Scott. He's not the one that I dealt with while I was there but he tried to make the situation right. Thank you to Scott for at least trying to make it right.  (12/9/15, around 6:30 PM, drive thru and I went inside)"}
{"text":"So reviewing McDonald's is like reviewing America. It's been around a while and everybody has had time to form their own opinion. The thing I will review today is their new oatmeal. I usually hit Starbucks every morning before the gym for coffee and their \"perfect oatmeal\" as they call it. I like it enough and it's a cheap, healthy, low calorie breakfast. I was curious when Micky D's started pitching their own. I have now tried it a few times at a few different locations and have to admit, it might be better! It's a tad more money and a tad higher in calories but it tastes and looks lie a better product. \n\nNext time you are hitting that drive thru for a sausage/bacon/Mcbiscuitmuffin sandwich, try the oatmeal instead and give your body and wallet a small break!"}
{"text":"This location is on point I don't come to McDonald's often but I do have to say this one is pretty outstanding through the drive-through. Always so fast and really friendly. It's a great location."}
{"text":"I don't know how a restaurant can consistently get your order wrong. This is my neighborhood MCD's and if there was anything else close by, I would go there. Been coming to this place for years and for years they continuously get the order wrong. The help in this place does not deserve $15 an hour, they don't deserve the $7.50 they are getting paid.\nA normal order for our family would be 5 or six sandwiches and fries etc. The order thru the drive thru will always be missing something. ALWAYS. \n\nThis morning, 3 sausage egg mc muffins, 2 sausage mcmuffin no egg, 2 sausage mcmuffin no cheese. 7 sandwiches total. Get home 5 sandwiches. The only way to deal with these people is to hold up the line and take everything out of the bag and inventory it before driving off. It is a shame, but you must do that. They will never get the order right. Complained to some Mexican woman who was manager on duty. All she said was sorry. Here is another sandwich. Next customer please."}
{"text":"I mean, it's McDonald's. It's not a 5 star restaurant but I prefer this location over all the others. When I get off work I will swing by and get a little late dinner. They have never messed up my order. They usually even end up giving me extra stuff for free because I go late at night and they either have to throw it away or give it away. \n\nAgain, as far as prices vs quality...its McDonald's. You get what you pay for. The manager Amanda is always so cool and very nice and friendly. \n\nEither way, this is a pretty easy review. I prefer this one over many other McDonald's."}
{"text":"Came to this McDonald's because it's the good one in this part of Henderson. I stand corrected. Maybe all McDonald's are all bad all the time now. If you have a brand new promotion for a new sandwich you can't serve an old chicken pattie.  They agreed it was old. However, they're almost dumbfounded that I was willing to wait 8 minutes to get a fresh one. I don't understand what fast food is doing anymore. They are not that much faster. They have all this new equipment only serve lukewarm microwave quality food. It makes no sense.\nTo top it all off, in the old days they offer you a free coupon for a free pie. Now, they act like they're doing you a favor by giving you the right hot food that you ordered in the first place. I think that this will be my last stop at any #McDonalds ever unless its for some random travel reason. It's one thing that it's not good for you But to not taste good or be convenient on top of it; what's the point?\nNote: this location is still better than the sunset and Stephanie location."}
{"text":"If I can give no star .I will give no star, they don't  deserve  a star.Today,the cashier messed up my credit card with their credit machine and was asking me for another form of payment , the manager instead of apologizing was yelling at me and even said she will call the police if I didn't move.This is not a good place to eat. Please stay away from this location. The staff is rude and tgey don't take responsibility for the mistakes of their employees. Again stay away from from this mac donald location please."}
{"text":"I've been going here for over 8 years and lately it's lacking so much it's worth my time to comment. We just went by at 2:30 a.m and were the only ones in line the entire time. The manager was slacking or just flirting with the rest of the staff cuz she could care less about our order until I mentioned it. Food was old and the service was severely lacking coming from someone who has worked in food services for over 15 years."}
{"text":"This place constantly screws up orders. Today we order mozz sticks and no sauce. Come on people you have one job. How the hell are these guys justifying a wage increase? Braindead America here we come"}
{"text":"I come often to this location and they are supposed to be serving dinner 24 hours.  But every night they do not. In fact most nights is a limited breakfast and cash only.  This upsets many customers as I see them speed away when I pull up and suspect what has happened when they don't stop at window to pick up food."}
{"text":"The people are always SO friendly in the drive through in the morning. My order is always correct.\n\nThis place is mega busy in the mornings. I often want to go through the drive through on my way to work, and have pulled into the parking lot only to pull back out and skip breakfast because it's so busy. They really need to have additional people working there for the rush hour traffic in the mornings. I have also sometimes gone inside in the mornings, and the line will be really slow to move, so again, sometimes I've just walked back out.\n\nThey would get a lot more of my business, and I'm sure of others', if the line moved quicker!\n\nI do also appreciate how clean and pretty the location is. There are often fresh flowers on the table, which is a nice touch. There are also TVs to watch."}
{"text":"This McDonald's provides the best customer service of any fast food restaurant I've ever been to.  I always leave here feeling better then when I entered. Great service!"}
{"text":"Wonderful store! Filled with caring employees and managers! Thank you McDonalds on GreenValley, for your support! Very kind and sweet manager!"}
{"text":"The slowest McDonald's I have ever been to. It took 7 minutes to order at the drive through. Girl said I'll be right with you and came back a year later. Corporate needs to visit ASAP"}
{"text":"Normally, I try to stay away from fast-food in general and McDonald's specifically. However, whenever I have a craving for McDonald's, this particular location is my favorite. They do brisk business so all my meals were hot and fresh. Inside the restaurant is cleaner than most other stores and the staff have been mostly friendly and helpful. You should expect a wait in the drive-through, but that just means your order will most likely be just-made and hot (think fries)."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is literally one minute from where I live and I'm super disappointed that it sucks! I went there last night and pulled in real quick to grab some food and this sweet little girl came on the speaker and said \"good morning, we're not taking any more orders due to technical difficulties.\" I was like \"ok, no worries\" and left. As I pulled away, I thought wtf, technical difficulties? I was annoyed but what do I know? Maybe they really were having issues so I left and ended up going somewhere else. Not that bad right? Well here's the kicker..so I'm driving back from where I ended up getting food from and as I pass this McDonald's I see FOUR cars in line ordering and picking up their food! WTF. Obviously their \"technical difficulties\" cleared up real quick cuz I had only left about 10 mins earlier. As I reflected on this bullshit, I realized this was like the fourth time they've done this. Always a different excuse. GRANTED-I went at like 3am but still...don't advertise that you're open 24 hours then pick and choose when you serve. RUDE! I don't like my job either but I still do it. Not wasting my time again."}
{"text":"I don't understand how after midnight you cannot order grilled or crispy chicken wraps. Especially considering a crispy chicken wrap is chicken that is cooked in a fryer that could be made in 10 minutes. I do not mind waiting the 10 minutes but the fact that they said they won't do it ridicoulus now I remember why I quit eating there. Its garbage."}
{"text":"Food took a while it was at night I was looking at apartments on that street all the way up the street but this is the only McDonalds in the vicinity and there's no other real restaurant in for a mile or two going up to Henderson"}
{"text":"This is about as good as McDonald's gets in Las Vegas.  Sometimes they forget things in my order, but everybody is friendly, fast and the food is always cooked properly.  It's weird how the ingredients at one location can vary so much.  Everything is always fresh here."}
{"text":"The usual McDonald's experience.  I go here about once per week since it's close to home.  They've messed up my order about 3 times in the past few years.  It's never good when you get home and somethings missing, especially if it's for the kids.  I still think they should no charge you for one sauce with your fries too.  Just my two cents :-)"}
{"text":"I don't come here often, but twice now out of no more than 10 visits, I've ordered a specialty pie, they ring it up, then once I pull up to the last window, \"oh sorry, we don't have any pies.\" Now the reason for my poor review is because the last time this happened, they gave me two apple pies to make up for it--ok cool! Until I found the two apple pies to be cold."}
{"text":"I have not been to McDonalds in years and this visit reminded me why, but let's start with the positive.   I don't remember the interior decor of McDonalds being so modern, but this particular location is spacious, clean, and has lots of room to sit.\n\nBut unfortunately it's McDonald's and the food cannot be helped. Looking at the menu it has more options then most 5 star restaurants.  This is fast food.  Stick to the basics and be good at them.   I went with chicken nuggets (BBQ sauce for dipping), French fries and a drink.   All very bland, with no flavor, and my drink was flat.  Would have been better just drinking the BBQ sauce.  There was more fried outer shell on the nuggets than chicken.  \n\nUnless your in a pinch and need food to essentially fuel your body before you pass out, skip the Golden Arches, as they are definitely not in the race for the top fast food choice anymore.\n\nThe upgraded interior and spacious accommodations is the only reason for the two stars and not one.  Please just focus on the basics of my youth."}
{"text":"My kids love McDonalds but my issue is that the do not cater for food allergies, Having celiac disease (a gluten allergy) I cannot eat over 95% of what McDonalds make but yet my kids love the place.  I wish that they would offer bun alternative or protein style alternatives like Carls Junior or Inn n Out burger.\n\nOn the whole my kids love going here but I wish it was more allergy friendly"}
{"text":"I am mainly a drive-thru customer so that is primarily what I am reviewing. With folks who roll up to the ordering speaker with no clue what they want or they have a car full of people all trying to order different things by passing their orders to the driver aside.........the folks actually working the drive-thru (who also have to deal with those folks) are great. Employees at both windows are friendly, always smiling, and take time to briefly interact with you to let you know they care that you come by. My orders have been correct (a tiny, minor oops a time or two, usually with getting the coffee the way I order it).  We'll get there....one Splenda....three cream....one Splenda and three cream. :-)\n\nBut even with that, the drive thru folks are efficient, friendly, and convenient. \n\nNow, if Corporate would just do a tiny little restructuring of the parking lot, that part of the equation would get that other star!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's \"almost\" the worst McDonalds I've ever been to. It's like they don't listen when you tell them your order. You have to repeat what you want at least 3 times. Then your order is completely wrong anyways. Fries usually have WAY too much salt on them and/or are old. Do not go here. It's not worth the frustrations."}
{"text":"It's McDonalds need I say more. Inside is small but the service has always been great.  Don't ask for a Moca in the morning something is always wrong with the machine.  That seems to be the norm. Everything else is great!"}
{"text":"As our food was being prepared another customer was eating our fries. When the cashier was told about it, the reply was \"he didn't know\". Is it ok to eat other peoples food off of their trays and make excuses for it? Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is literally THE worst mcdonalds I have ever been to. The food quality is terrible and the customer service isn't any better. We come thru often because we live very close by and 5 out of 5 times there has been some type of issue. Whether it be cold food, the wrong food, or food cooked in old oil. You just can't win here! We have driven back to mcdonalds to get new food made once because the quality was so bad and the manager saw us walk in and she went to the back and made a crew member deal with it. A store shouldn't be ran this way."}
{"text":"The food is McDonalds quality, you either like it or you don't, but I like that they are fast & hire very nice young people (OMG! Only old people say that, so I must be getting up there, lol). I'm giving them 4 stars because it's always a pleasant experience to go through their drive through :) \n\nI do have to add that their speaker was on the fritz & I did let them know. Still, it's not like I wasn't going to drive another few feet & talk to someone in person. At 5 am when I'm prepping for my long drive East, this is really not a big deal, lol. \n\nI've been inside & it could probably use a remodeling, but it is what it is!"}
{"text":"It is close to home, I love going during the week because the food and service. The service on the weekends is very slow. One night my husband and I went and it was not yet closing hours and as we drove up to the drive in they shut off the lights at the drive in and at the windows. They mix up our orders a WHOLE lot and it seems like we cannot get quality fries they are either old or cold."}
{"text":"One of the worst McDonald's , seems like service is always worse at night ! Always getting orders mixed up and have been given someone else's order as well ."}
{"text":"We go here very often cause we work near by. We always send a food runner to pick up food for about 6 of us since we work the night shift. It might just be their night shift but they are always forgetting for peoples food. ALWAYS!"}
{"text":"Love this McDonald's as it has a 24-hour drive thru!  After having gone to Bar 244, and Smoke's Poutinerie, the best friend and I needed something sweet to top it off and were craving McDonald's Ice Cream. Thank you for having a 24 hour drive thru to satisfy our cravings!"}
{"text":"This McDonalds gets lots of $$$ off my friend and I, for good reason too. Freshly made burgers, fast paced environment. We get served right away either from drive thru or going inside. Never have to wait that long, food is always cooked new, nothing is ever soggy or weird tasting and it helps knowing my friend lives so close by. Drive thru is open 24 hours :) and few new items on the menu right now are the creme br√ªl√©e mcflurry ( tastes like the Starbucks creme br√ªl√©e frap) shamrock smoothie(it's thick, minty and green)  and double filet o fish ( 2 pieces of fish filets in one burger, omg yay because I never feel full from just one of these so I hope it stick around.\n\nMy friend got the McChicken burger combo with fries and medium sized Fruitopia drink and I got the Filet o fish combo with fries as well but I got the medium sized Coca Cola. We tried to make it restaurant like and got dessert too in the end haha, we both tried the new McFlurry Creme Brulee, it tasted really good but we struggled to finish it because we were so full.\n\nTotal Bill was below $20"}
{"text":"If you like dry rubbery meat, sparse toppings, soggy old fries and burnt coffee then you're in luck! This is the place for you. \n\nBreaking away from the tradition of other McDonald's this location spits in the face of what people consider \"edible\" food and takes their own special spin on all your favorites! So get some pepto bismol ready and buckle up for a failure of a meal!"}
{"text":"Well the free coffee got me in there. Simply to say that the coffee is good. I could not get myself to order anything else. Nothing appealed to me. But the Java was good, in fact better than Second Cup or Tim Horton's. Not the same atmosphere but better tasting and the sipping cover is a of a unique design.\n\nAll in all for free coffee (available until March 14th) a good deal."}
{"text":"Not a lot I can say because I seriously visit McDonald's locations for one thing only: the Vanilla Reduced Fat Ice Cream Cone! It is very delicious, just one dollar (range between 99 cents to $1.29, not including sales tax), and just 170 calories! I cannot complain. We went through the Drive-Thru for our first visit and it went smoothly. Short wait with just 3-4 cars ahead of us. Clear speaker, the associate asked us to verify our order on the screen (great!), and there were separate windows for paying and receiving your food. Everyone was very cordial as well. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Worst drive through service ever.  The cashier taking payment was rude and the person giving the food to you through drive through pretty much through the bag out the window.  If you don't like your job get a new one you like,  no one is making you work I. This place.  Your actions reflect on on your body language.  Rude and very unprofessional.  Good luck"}
{"text":"Go the the rainbow location instead. This location constantly forgets napkins and the staff is rarely friendly. Worth it to just drive a couple miles to the other location."}
{"text":"This place is like any other MCD's locations. The drive thru is pretty quick and my order was ready as I pulled up to the 2nd window after paying. Exactly how a drive thru should be!"}
{"text":"Where do they hire their employees? Just plain rude. They need to take a customer service 101 class because they are obviously lacking it! Guy taking orders/handling money was rude talking to me like I'm an idiot. Then when I pulled up to the last window, the girl gave me my food, no greeting whatsoever. She just opened the window & said 'here you go' then closed the window. Horrible food and horrible service."}
{"text":"One of the worst McDonald's in town. Food is half cooked every time time I come here and tastes stale."}
{"text":"Their \"systems were down\" and the manager just slammed the window in our face with absolutely no empathy at all.. Only asked if we had cash for him to pocket it! This is completely ridiculous. Don't ever come here if you want to use your arm or credit card, this is the 21st century. Food and service horrible as hell."}
{"text":"So apparently cash only late night? Fabulous... Try putting a sign out to advertise this so people don't get stuck in the drive through line for 10 minutes like an idiot like I just did.... Thanks I guess for saving me those late night impulse calories. I'll be sure to remember this on my future late nights. As like the only fast food place between Durango and rainbow on blue diamond, you sure have a lot of customers that you should cater to. #mcdonoldsfail"}
{"text":"Wait is minimal and staff usually pretty good. Food is hit or miss but I will still come back. Breakfast is the best meal they do!"}
{"text":"We waited for about 10 minutes for our order and when our number was called.... We got cold french fries and cold cheeseburger!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to agree with everybody's comment here, it's by far the worst drive thru experience I've ever had in my entire McDonald fan!!   I ordered choc chip frappe and 2apple pie; when I got to the window to pick up my order (which took 35mins) I was asked if it is ok to not have a choc chip in it because they ran out?  What?Really?They should have said that 30mins ago so I could have left and not waste time waiting for me paying full price for half service?? You joking right?If there's zero negative star on here, they'll get it!"}
{"text":"I take into account that this is McDonalds, I really do, but this one might be one of the worst I've ever been to. This is right near my house and since I get off work pretty late, there isn't many places open for me to grab food quickly. I've gone through the drive thru on a few separate occasions thinking to myself, \"This HAD to be a fluke! They must be having a bad day, maybe next time!\" No. EVERY TIME. \n\nOn tonight's particular trip I ordered a regular two cheese burger meal and two orders of apple pie, but first asking to make sure they had apple pie ready to go (I've made that mistake once before). They stated that they had it, I drove up to the first window and paid. Second window, a manager pops his head out stating they don't have apple pies (even though they stated they did) and asks me to pick something else. Unfortunately, I don't want anything else and although the refund for two apple pies, give or take, is $1.38, I ask for a refund. He again asks me to order something else instead. No thank you, I wanted Apple pies, I don't wish to order anything else in their place. He comes back with my refund and says goodbye. Wait?!? My food!! He says he cancelled it because I didn't want anything else!! WHAT?!?! \n\nNever. Ever. Again. This is why I don't eat fast food!! Ugh!!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and this Filipino lady forgot to give me dipping sauce for my nuggets or napkins. So I kindly asked her, how come you guys never ask me if I need any sauce like other places? She said, don't tell me how to do my job. Easy cowgirl!"}
{"text":"Don't come to this mickey D's. The service is very poor. Ordered 2 holiday pies last night through the drive through but DID NOT RECIEVE THEM . Tried to call the number on the receipt but busy for ten minutes. Went back to this store and was told by manager it takes ten minutes to cook pies! What? Drive down a few blocks and get awesome service at rainbow and blue diamond!"}
{"text":"One does not expect much from fast food restaurants these days however this place manages to provide an even lesser service than the low standards of today."}
{"text":"Do I have to give them 1 star you all should consider this a negative star.Absolutely the worst fast food service I've ever experienced.Every order I've gotten has been in some way or the other wrong.i check every order but I'm not opening boxes n unwrapping sandwiches.Today I ordered an egg n cheese Mc muffin got em home n they put ham on em.the worst one was couple of months back they had those wings n I ordered them n sat at window for 7 min been in line for 10 then Mgr asks me to pull up to wait in s designated space .I'm just sitting there before I realize I've been there another 10 min and there are no cars in line. I drove over to front door went in an there's the Mgr sitting at a dinning room table eating.i asked her where my food was that I've been waiting for 15 minutes outside.i was so mad I just took my food n left.2 months later stupid me went back for another screw up.Buy the way this Mgr is on duty 90 percent of time I go there.I was a Mgr for 20 years in fast food n sit down I wouldn't hire this lady as a cashier"}
{"text":"If it was possible to give 0 stars i would ive never been to this location and not had an issue, this time was the wost they over charged us and still didnt give us half our order when we got our bags, the employees didnt know how to deal with the issue, nor did the manager, its like none of them are mentally there. I strongly advise to stay away from this location."}
{"text":"All I have to say is that these damn people want $15 an hour and they can't get the simple things right.... Manager I just spoke to was also rude. I should have chewed this up and spit it back in the bag and got my money back."}
{"text":"Came here because I got a free sandwich coupon.. Decided to try the artisan chicken... I feel like none of the McDonald's higher ups have ever been to Wendy's.. They have to be completely oblivious to what the chicken sandwiches look like there to serve this crap. 4 of McDonald's chicken would equal one of Wendy's. And even if it was bigger the quality is crap. I had a free coupon and I wanted a refund... Service was ok. Still won't go back for a very long time if at all"}
{"text":"Worst McDonalds ever!!! Always gets my orders wrong. From giving me 4 nuggets instead of 6, to not giving me my fries or putting ketchup on a PLAIN burger. Slowest drive thru service as well!!!"}
{"text":"What do you do when you go to a restaurant and they forget one of your items? You think \"eh, they made a mistake\" how about ten of the last ten times you've been there? You would think you would stop going after the third time..... I guess I'm a glutton for punishment..... And being stole from, because that's what this store does. I sat down today after getting home and no Big Mac was in the bag, and, in the last few months, I figured out they have stolen around $40 of food that I have paid for And what happens when you try and call the store? Always busy. How about the 800 number? \"Leave a message and we will call you back\".... And you never get a call. It's the worst customer service for a company I have ever seen. How much money is this one location stealing from customers? I get that the employees are getting paid a pittance of a wage but have some respect for your work. Both my wife and I work for a burger chain and if this happened at our stores, corporate would be there and all hell would break loose. But I'm sure corporate doesn't know because the numbers you call to complain A) do not work/ are always busy or B) never pass on the info and just bury it and accept it as business as usual. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yeah.... I love Mickey D's. But this is the slowest McDonalds on Earth. And they dont even care at all how long. I mean.... I get its fast food. And the people working here dont make much at all for all the bs they go thru. But yeah... This one just kills me."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero, I would. I was in line wondering why this place had 1  1/2 stars? While reading and laughing in disbelief at how people received half of their meat or sundaes, I then realized my drink was a victim of their shortness. The first thing i noticed was when I pulled up to pay for my food, the kid at the window did not open it right away nor did he acknowledged me. So I thought maybe I pay at the second window. When I started to drive away, the kid said no wait right here. Hmm, have you not been schooled in customer service? Then of course, my drink. The cup was not filled and had two cups. The kid was not on correctly and I partially blame the two cups.. but holy cow, this place is going down in the crapper. I hope the management is aware of their decline in business is due to lack of training and customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 chocolate sundae on a Weds at 11:45am and received 2 mini sundaes instead. I think they have an ice cream shortage because they gave me a kids size. Lol"}
{"text":"This McDonald's never gets the orders right, NEVER! It doesn't matter if it's breakfast, lunch or dinner, they never listen to orders taken. This is seriously so irritating and we have to go out of our way back, walk in and get the correct order. I'm very tired of this and now I either check the order before leaving drive thru due to there incompetent employees and hold everybody up or just never return to this location ever again!"}
{"text":"Knowing how bad the drive through service has been I went inside and placed an order for a burger. The lobby wasn't trashed but in a need of a sweep and a wipe down. \n\nI ordered my Habanero Quarter Pounder and sat at one of the only clean tables in the store. The register guy did come out to sweep and while he did try his best I have to wonder why he choose to move the chairs at my table and sweep below my feet (remember that it was the only clean table in the store) and ignore what I'm only guessing was a hunk of apple on the floor at the table across from me or the fry and salt residue on the seats of the same table? He even went so far as to pick up a stack of napkins from the floor and put them onto the table top. \n\nI know I know young kid working his first job trying so hard but he/they desperately need to go back to the McDonald University and get some remedial training or this store is going to fail to earn repeat business from its locals."}
{"text":"went thru drive thru....got 2 cheeseburger meal......got home.....open one of the said cheeseburgers to put fries on it (don't knock it until you try it).....and found this.......HALF of a patty......really crappy McDonald's........REALLY FRICKEN CRAPPY"}
{"text":"Had ordered a big Mac and jalapeno double and it is the first time I had to call and let them know how the food is. The big mac's lettuce was soggy and old and the jalapeno double had little to no sauce and three jalapeno slices. The fries were refried over and over cause they were Brown and way over salted. I called and the manager was super nice apologized and offered me two meals at no cost and never mentioned I needed a receipt because I had already told her I threw it away. She said she would just write down my name and put it in the books. I take up the offer on a different day and they don't know what I'm talking about, I pay but get home and the buns are burnt and the order was wrong again. I asked for no meat on the mcmuffin for my daughter and what do they add on, meat. Yeah I can take it off myself but the point is is obviously they do not listen to there customers or just don't pay attention, I mean every encounter there they always forget, or simply make a mistake. Either way I'm taking my business else where. Management is not organized and you can't trust their words! The crew is super nice though! I didn't want to have to post this or the pictures but they aren't listening so maybe they need to see it, pretty sure I wouldn't need a receipt now."}
{"text":"My visit here was my cycling lunch stop, so I was probably more happy than the average patron to see these golden arches.  This McDs is renovated in the dark-wood-meets-quasi-Starbucks-style and while all appeared trendy and chic (one could even watch the game on the suspended flat-screen TV), closer inspection revealed a floor that needed to be swept and a few tables that required a good wipedown.  We had to wait longer than I wanted (10 minutes!) for my food, but then again, I was only half done my 50 mile ride at that point and wanted food NOW.  Also, exacerbating the wait, I know that drive-thru customers get priority, due to corporate demanding fast order-to-receipt times.  However, my fries were salty and hot, my burger was fresh and tasted the same as other McDs burgers I've consumed, and child chatter was minimal.  ;)"}
{"text":"They literally mess up my order EVERY single time! I make the extra drive and go to the one in rainbow and blue diamond!"}
{"text":"I don't know why but it always seems like the employees at the second window are always rude. They are so stingy on sauces even if you paid for it. The stinginess also comes with a side of attitude."}
{"text":"I went through the drive threw to place my order.  When I hit home, it was wrong.  I called to inform them.  They were extremely nice and apologetic.  I went back the next day to get my order replaced.  They were very nice and gave me a extra order of fries.  I appreciate friendly service.  The error was a little frustrating but everyone makes mistakes."}
{"text":"This is got to be one of the worse McDonald's ever, even surpassing the McDonalds In Hawthorn Nevada!\n\nStopped there two times in two days, I was sick and didn't want to cook or get out of the car. Plus, as a child when I got sick my mother would buy me a Big Mac.\n\nAnyway, we stopped and went thru the drive thru, it was pretty quick both times. Our larger truck fit through, so that is a good thing.\n\nThe first trip, my husband, also sick, drove off as soon as the food was handed to us. I'm all like what are doing? I haven't tried the fries yet! Anyway, the fries were either over cooked,( I don't think so), or cooked twice. The amount of salt was unreal and the fries were cooked beyond crispy.\n\nSecond trip, the fries looked like McDonalds fries just not very warm, and yes he drove off before I tried one. We get back to the R.V. resort we're staying at and I try my Big Mac, almost no sauce and very bland. The patties also look like they have gotten smaller.\n\nThe two ladies at the window were not overly friendly but not rude either. If you want a burger just stop at In and Out across the street."}
{"text":"This is the worse McDonald's I have ever been to. This place is consistently bad. 8/10 times I visit this place they get something wrong. For example I use to always order a Bic Mac and I would have them put the quarter pounder patties on it. Every time I order from this place they mess it up. The last time which was yesterday I ordered this They only made half the sandwich. They literally left the top half of the Big Mac empty. If you are not familiar I will explain. They should have made it with the bottom bun, on top of the bottom bun you add the hamburger then on top of the meat you add the toppings. Then on top of the toppings there should be a middle bun, then on top of the middle bun more toppings then on top of the toppings the top bun. They got it right to the middle bun. There was only 1 pattie on the sandwich after the middle bun there was nothing. \n\nIt never fails every time I order here. I have had half my order missing which I paid for. I always forget to check the bag and I just drive home because like most i'm in a hurry. Its gotten so bad I don't even go back anymore. A few weeks ago I remembered to check the bag and I went in to have them fix it. It took them 3 tries. I sent the food back 3 times. I was nervous they were going to spit in it. \n\nThey never get sauces and extras correct. I always order a side of Big Mac sauce because I like to dip my fires in it. I never get it. They always make damn sure they charge me for it, but I never get it. I order hot mustard for nuggets they always give me honey mustard. I have asked for hot mustard a couple times and the person taking my order looked at me like I was retarded and had to go get the manager to figure out their sauces.\n\nIf I could give this place 0 stars or take stars away I would. Simply horrible they need either a staffing change or a management change."}
{"text":"The last time I went here, the dining area was literally infested with flies. Flies everywhere. I could barely fill my soda cup because I was so mortified by the swarm of flies that were surrounding me. It was gross and I've never been so terrified in a McDonald's."}
{"text":"Zero stars. They mess up my order Every. Single. Time. Without fail. This time, they tried to charge me again for stuff they didn't put in my bag. $15 an hour guys?? Come on. I wouldn't come back to this location if it was the last McDonald's in las vegas."}
{"text":"I have never written a review on Yelp but I am so frustrated I feel the need to.\n\nI get to the window and my total is $7.12. I handed the guy $12.12 thinking it would make things easier to just get back a five. Boy was I wrong. He entered $11.12 into the register handing me 4 dollars back. Why the hell would I give you dollars to get back more dollars? Clearly that never occured to him, and if it did he just tried to steal a dollar from me....which btw wouldn't be the first time here. I tell the guy in the next window which looked like a manager and he asks me quite rudely \"Are you sure you gave him 12 dollars?\" I explain to him I normally wouldn't say nething especially for a dollar but it has been happening so many times that all these dollars add up. He takes my change back and returns with 5 $1 dollar bills without saying a word...no apology...no explanation so I leave. It wasn't until I got home that I realized a sandwich is missing from my bag. So not just did they try and short me a dollar from my change they leave out a chicken sandwich. THIS IS THE WORST FAST FOOD RESTAURANT/MCDONALDS EVER!!!! I never get what I order and now my change is getting stolen."}
{"text":"Disgusted, posted a photo of the coffee I got with a long hair in it! How do they not see that!!? Nasty"}
{"text":"One thing I look forward to is fries....well they managed to screw that up too because we all love cold old fires. Common guys you ask for more money but you can't get a simple order right?!?!? Not to mention the drive through employee who didn't even say a simple \"hi\" just handed me the bag and closed the window. By far the worst service I have ever had at a drive through."}
{"text":"They almost never get my order right. We went today and got chicken nuggets and they forgot to give the sauce to dip it in."}
{"text":"Seriously, an order of 20 pc nuggets and you give us TWO sauces when I asked for sweet n sour & honey mustard! (Only honey mustard was in there) If you're a normal person, you know it takes maybe four-five sauces to finish all nuggets. You guys are ridiculous."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, they've always messed up my order.\n\nThis morning my daughter didn't have sausage with her hot cakes nor did she get her apple juice. All these things add up. My bill for 3 people came up to approximately $22.00 I could go back and ask them for the missing items but in always in a hurry. I'm a busy working mother and that's  why I rely on fast food to do the feeding for me sometimes but this location always fails to give me my orders. Meh."}
{"text":"ok so yes they are new and yes it looks nice inside,but every time i go there my food is always i mean always wrong,and to make it ever worse is when you ask them to fix it and they still get it wrong, Thats pretty bad. And there are a few mangers there that just need to quit or be fired,they are rude ,they interrupt you when your tring to explain what was wrong.How does a sausage egg mcmuffin with no cheese turn into a ham egg and cheese biscut."}
{"text":"If I could give this place half a star or less then I would. Every time I come to visit, majority of the time there's something wrong with my order. But tonight takes the cake. It's not cool to sell a customer an expired item, especially when the label has the expiration date and time present on the product. I know the person is human and we make mistakes but it's not hard to check your dairy products' expiration dates to see if it's expired or not before you hand them to the customer. Especially since you serve milk and yogurt with your happy meals to children. My parfait was warm, the granola pack had maybe a pinch of granola in it (I know this they had no control over), and my happy meal came with no drink and fries. There just was all kinds of fuck ups and I'm just so annoyed/over with this location and their service."}
{"text":"I couldn't resist writing another review after this morning's stop for coffee... I had one car in front of me and I ordered just a caramel mocha $3.23. I waited well over 10 min thinking the car in front of me must have had a big order. When I finally got to the window nobody had yet started my mocha, and after a few minutes the drive thru girl came to tell me the McCafe machine was broken and she could give me a regular coffee.... At this point I was anxious to get out of the drive thru so I wasn't late for work so I agreed (cars behind me had started honking from being held up so long). Icing on the cake... No regular coffee made... WTH?!? They asked me to pull into the waiting spot and they would bring it to me... At this point I'm laughing because it's so ridiculous, don't open if you are not prepared... No offer to replace what I paid for, they brought me out a regular old coffee.. LOL. Strong work guys."}
{"text":"Meh, even with the amount of business this location gets, you rarely seem to receive fresh, hot fries. \n\nAnd if you order an ice cream cone, hope that it's not handed to you at the wide base (the part not covered by the paper wrapper) by an employee with a bandaged finger."}
{"text":"By far the WORST McDonald's I've ever been to!!!  If I could give it less then one star I would.  I live right down the street so this is the easiest McDonald's to get to, but ever time I go the wait is ridiculous, the serve is horrible, and the food is thrown together!  I suggest everybody go to the McDonald's off rainbow instead because it going to take just as long either way.   And their staff is a lot more friendly!!"}
{"text":"Worst MCD ever!!!! I mean it looks legit and super nice cause it's new. This place always messes up our order. Especially the older Filipino lady that works there. She has the like resting \"I hate my job\" face. Gives attitude and doesn't say sorry for not understanding English by messing up the damn orders! Who ever owns this franchise needs to replace her or who ever there that can't fulfill proper simple orders.  Make the extra drive down the street to the Rainbow one."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this McDonalds to open, it's about time we get a food place in that location. So you can imagine my disappointment with their terrible service and bad quality food making!!\n\n Worst. Worst. Worst. I get they are new. I do, so the first few times I went, I kept my cool, didn't complain, smiled, etc. \n\nI like to go mid-morning on my way to work for either just coffee and a Sausage McMuffin with no egg... How complicated of an order can it be??!! Sometimes I will mix it up and get a combo meal, this is usually where they royally screw it up. \n\nI'm irritated just thinking about the visits Ive had and how 4 out of 5 visits they screwed something up. \n\nTo make this brief, here are my major issues. \n\nI order Splenda to be added to my drink. I'm in my work clothes, and I don't want to pull over and carefully add it myself and spill on my clothes since they A) they always fill it too high, and B) I don't want to make any more stops! \n\nCheese: hardly ever melted on the Quarter Pounder, or Big Mac and I've tried about 3 or 4 times. Cheese not melted, or the tiniest blob of sauce! I wanted the new habanero ranch, couldn't even taste the sauce except for one bite! Plus it was luke-warm at least twice! The hot & spicy with a tiny splash of mayo? I mean, really! \n\nI ordered an iced Caramel Mocha, get to the window, she hands me the latte, it had no caramel on the whip, so I ask, is this the Caramel Mocha? She stares at me blankly and says yes, I say, I'm used to it having caramel on top, she says its a caramel mocha, so off to work I go, I'm already late because they are super SLOW, and sure enough take a sip after I'm gone and it's a regular mocha. Pathetic service!\n\nI did write in to corporate after my 8th or 10th attempt to do business there.. And the manager called me and apologized. Told me to come in and get a free combo on him. So not happening. Go in so they can remember me as the Girl who called them out for their shit slow service, always messing up my orders,  and crap food making? No thanks. I would have rather had some coups sent so I could remain anonymous. \n\nOh well. I just drive a few more blocks down to Rainbow and Blue Diamond location if i have the extra time, they are great! \n\nAs for this place? Shame on you for STILL not being able to get your shit together! \n\nOne positive note I will say is there are two very friendly employees there. They work the drive thru taking orders/$$ I wish I had their names! \n\nWill I be back? Sadly probably yes, it's very convenient for me on my way to work when I don't have time to go to rainbow location.. But I limit what I get, try to keep it simple and always hope for the best... Maybe someday they will be a great location... As for now? The McDonald's Corporation would be ashamed!!!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't give a place 1 star if I didn't give them a second chance, but after coming here countless times (it's the closest one to my house) I would say something has gone wrong at least 50% of the time. Literally.\n\nBefore I leave the drive-thru, I always have to check every thing to make sure it's right. It slows down the line, but I've learned to take this measure since they almost ALWAYS give me the wrong items. Whenever I ask for a plain burger, it comes to me with everything on it. There have been two times I ask for a 4-piece kids meal and they put a burger in it.\n\nThe most recent time, the person at the drive-thru was so incompetent. I could tell he was new because it took nearly 5 minutes to take my order because he couldn't hear me when I was speaking at a normal drive-thru volume. And as I was pulling away, he said \"I think I messed up.\" into the mic. Like? The employees here are never mean/rude, but the incompetence is so annoying. It's been MONTHS of coming here and they need to work on being proficient in making sure every order is right. I'd rather wait a bit more for them to double-check than for me to have to and come back to get a change."}
{"text":"Staff gets 5 stars, friendliest staff in a McDonald's I have ever been too. Food was mediocre,  nuggets tasted funny."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happens here. The shift manager was complaining to the only other customer at the counter how this is broken & that is broken & how it's so frustrating. Try being on my side of the counter waiting & waiting while three ladies deal with the drive-thru (which was packed), 3 other employees are floating about the dining room & the said shift manager is filling up a coffee cup which never fills because it has a hole in it.\nNow the whole thing about multiple things being broken transported me right back to the fiasco at McDonalds in Banning CA last month where a lot of stuff was broken. One other thing I found strange. There were 18 cars in the parking lot. So seeing how this is McDonalds & it would seem unlikely for each car to be carrying just 1 person (especially the soccer mom vans), I was expecting to see this place packed inside. Nope. There were only 9 people in the place. Maybe this is a Park n Ride lot! \nFood was standard Micky D's. Breakfast burrito's were hot & tasty. Considering they're a buck, quite the deal. The drink station was a mess as were a few tables in the dining area. Not sure what the 3 employees meandering about the dining room were up to. One was pushing the mop bucket around and another had a rag in her hand. However, the table next to me was dirty & she walked right past it & didn't seem to care. Not sure about the 3rd one. Maybe just got back from break! That dirty table, never got cleaned the whole time we were there."}
{"text":"terrible!!! everytime I ask for a quarter pounder WITH NO CHEESE, they put cheese on it. is it that hard to listen? -.-"}
{"text":"Lol. Quarter pounder with cheese and a big Mac. No lettuce. Drive through repeated it. 1st window repeated it. Last window repeated it. Too bad I still got lettuce."}
{"text":"The morning manager was rude and didn't like being \"bothered\". Hash browns were cold when they were given to me and the women's bathroom is infested with ants! Counted at least ten ants in one stall alone!! Health code issue right there. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and will be my last time here I went through the drive thru and they ask for a large Coke and I was told it was out of order I would not recommend coming here if you need better service go to chick flick a..."}
{"text":"So I go to  McDonald's  late once in awhile  and this location is  serving garbage after midnight  when I have went during the day it's fine but late at night they shut down all of there ice cream maker  stuff and the food tastes like they were supposed too throw  out. I also think something fishy is going on  there was a police officer in front of me  and he paid with a credit card and I was instructed I was only aloud cash payment   which I had cash  but why do they want cash if they can do credit weird  sh@$."}
{"text":"Dry, tough, leathery filet-o-fish. How is that even possible? Buttermilk crispy chicken (you know, the $5 one, not the dollar McChicken) was inedible for the same reason.\n\nWe've given this McD many chances because it's the closest to our place, but it is hands-down the worst McDonald's we've been to. They get our order wrong more often than not. But there was just no excuse for tonight's overcooked, clearly sitting-around-under-a-heat-lamp food. With the wait we had, we thought at least we'd get fresh hot fries, but nope."}
{"text":"I've giving this mcds plenty of chances to get it right and all I get is burgers and breakfast sandwiches that are dry and look like they been sitting for hours. So Disappointed I've given up on this mcds."}
{"text":"Women's restroom nasty and worn out fixtures. Told 2 employees, first one just smiled and nodded. Second said OK went about her business.  To bad I'm not with the health dept."}
{"text":"No one should EVER be able to sit in the drive-thru and write a review on Yelp while waiting for their order! There is no GOOD reason why it's taking this long. My goodness! And don't just throw my food and money at me! And these cold ass fries! Im so glad I dont eat this bs any more! Holy cow!"}
{"text":"Horrible and it gets worse every time I go I swear it will be the last time.  No a/c in the building, still serving customers.  Shift manager Adrianna?? says she is doing everything she can, but really is she?  I asked for the general managers name and she refused to give it to me.  I pay to sit down and eat in comfort so my grandson can play in the play area, I expect a/c when it is 120 degrees outside.  I am going to write to corporate about this place.  Maybe need some new shift managers?"}
{"text":"Mm. Delicious! Bring  Mc ribs back the staff  was excellent the food precisely grilled to perfection and the bathrooms were clean as A whistle what more could you ask for? There were no clowns in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this restaurant. I mean it's McDonald's... pretty consistent and everyone was great!"}
{"text":"Nasty .. Dirty ... Bad customer service .."}
{"text":"It's not the cleanest, they always get my order wrong... And in the morning it takes soooo long to get through the drive through."}
{"text":"This location CONSISTENTLY screws up drive-thru orders. It's always great coming home to realize there are item(s) missing. It's happened several times. So we'll pick a different one for a while, but occasionally come back to this one because it's closer to home.\n\nBut almost without fail, our order is screwed up, but we don't know it until we're home. It's not always practical to check and unwrap each and every item before leaving the parking lot. Nor should you have to. \n\nI thought McDonald's had tight corporate standards? I think they do, but somehow this location's consistent boobery is slipping through the cracks. \n\nEating in isn't much better. Everyone behind the counter just sort of shuffles around with no sense of urgency or purpose. You'll get your food when you get it. \n\nThey also frequently serve old food.\n\nThis is all frustrating, and at least a bit surprising, given that it's located in a good part of Chandler.\n\nNew management or ownership is really needed here."}
{"text":"Decided to try it out again late last night after midnight. Got the steakhouse sirloin burger. Dry as cardboard. Looked like it only had one cheese and hardly any srooms or onions. But mainly the meat was way too dry. Took few bites and tossed it. This is THE last try. did it for me for good. McD is definitely not good for late nights but I do like their ice coffee."}
{"text":"Always purchases from the dollar menu.  Fast service and hot food, can't beat that."}
{"text":"The service via drive thru is quick and efficient. I put in special order for my Big Mc Meal and it was made exactly the way I wanted."}
{"text":"Okay, I have a some rules. \n\nFast food places cannot earn Four Stars. My logic is somewhat simple and straight forward; it's  due to their uniformity and universal blandness. How can one Mickey D's, be better than another or differentiated?  Close you eyes and tell me where you are. Try it sometimes. \n\nThat said, this one is real close to being Four Stars. The folks behind the counter, Patti and Maria in particular are all very nice. They will go out of their for you and seem to really like their jobs.  Wow\n\nI come here a couple of mornings each week, not for the Egg McMuffin or Big Breakfast; but to order two egg whites. That's right, egg whites. They're only $0.98 each, and they'll allow you to substitute them on any sandwich for free. Throw in a coffee and you'll be out the door for less than four bucks. Nice!\n\nIt UR on a diet, or just want to eat healthier, I would highly recommend it.  So \"A-Okay\", bordering on \"yes, I'm a Fan\""}
{"text":"It's a regular McDonald's, somewhat newer and classier, with a McCaf√© built in.  Hamburgers, cheeseburgers, chicken McNuggets, and french fries are what they're all about.  It's also nice to go to a place with free refills on Coca-Cola!  The only thing that set this one apart from any other McD's I've been to was that you put your garbage and tray on some cart in the corner, cafeteria-style, when you are finished.\n\nIt's pretty conveniently located off the A81.\n\n1st to review badge, woohoo!!"}
{"text":"Ein merkw√ºrdiger Laden:\n\nWarum bietet man Saucen und Burger an, die man nicht mehr verkaufen kann, weil sie nicht vorhanden sind?\n\nWarum ist das Angebot laut T√ºraushang ein anderes, als das an der Kasse?\n\nWarum schmeckt der Mango-Milchshake nur nach Milch?\n\nWarum ist in der einen Apfelschorle fast nur Apfelsirup und in dem danach abgef√ºllten Becher Blubberwasser mit einem Hauch (Kunst-)Apfel?\n\nAlles Fragen, die ich mir sonst noch nie stellen musste  hier jedoch schon. \n\nLeute, das geht doch wohl besser?!"}

{"text":"Awful service and lazy employees. Every time I go there the drive thru takes FOREVER and order is always wrong."}
{"text":"I have been going to this McDonald's since high school.  In fact, it was probably one of the first fast food restaurants to open along this stretch of Route 30.  It has been transformed over the years and now its bragging rights includes the fact that the Big Mac Museum is located right inside the heart of their restaurant.\nI am always pleased with the warm environment of this place and the fact that it does not feel as though one is eating at a fast food restaurant . There is always something to look at and explore while you are inside the dining area.\n\nToday I stopped in for coffee and just happened to be treated to the activities of  a very large bustling group of regular diners know as The Sunshine Group.  This group is led by a wonderfully sweet 90-something year old McDonald's employee named Ruthie.  The group gets together to socialize, share a meal, and sing a few songs.  They were having the time of their lives just singing away on this very gloomy rainy day. \n\nI was invited to come over and join them and help myself to a muffin or two as long as I participated with them in singing a round of \"You Are My Sunshine\". Who could resist on such a rainy day?"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with a visit to a place that houses the world's largest big mac statue?!  \nReally, this McDonalds isn't that different than a typical McDonalds with the exception of there being history and facts about the Big Mac scattered throughout along with memorabilia from McDonald's history.  Well, that and the Big Mac statue (which is located in the kid's play area).\nService is about what you'd expect at a McDonalds and the prices and menu were identical to every other McDonalds I've ever been to.  But in those locations, you don't get the joy of learning the average amount of sesame seeds on a big mac bun."}
{"text":"This is actually like a 2.5 star review.\n\nIf you look back through my reviews you will note that I decidedly stay away from McDonald's as a whole.  I actually loathe McDonald's but I sucked it up and decided that I would give it a try on this one occasion because of what this place truly is, the Big Mac Museum.  Yes that is correct, this is a \"museum\" in the loose sense.  Museum would seem to just be a term slapped on this building just because.  What you would expect is a nice exhibit chronicling the Big Mac.  What you actually get is a few display cases and a few plaques throughout the main building.  Throw in a few tabletops that have some information written on them and that's what you get here.  That is a big gripe here, but only one of many.\n\nI appreciate them considering a Big Mac museum.  But why here, especially when the actual Big Mac was created in Uniontown, not the Irwin area.  I love how Pittsburgh tries to stake a claim to it too, but as the small amount of information given here it tells you Uniontown, a Fayette County town, is the rightful owner of that title.\n\nAfter years of not eating McDonald's I decided why not give it a try here.  Because of it being the Big Mac Museum I chose the Big Mac meal.  It's exactly how I remember it right down to the indigestion that followed.  The fries aren't what I remembered them to be.  Being that they serve Coke products for drinks, I had to go with a bottle of water.\n\nWith fast food restaurants attempting to draw people in, this is nothing more than a gimmick to bring you in.  So in my book, and one stop location."}
{"text":"Good old Big Mac Museum.. You have been my neighborhood Micky Ds for my entire life, so I have been spoiled by your uniqueness.  Reguardless of the cool and nastalgic interior you possess, your food is always good and my order is usually always correct from what I can remember.  \n\nIf you are a McDonald's fan and have not seen the museum yet, you really should see it.  This place is much different than any other McDonalds.  Its got history under those arches!!"}
{"text":"I don't get the four star rating for this place.\n\nI mean first off it's a McDonalds.  If you're rating the food of the Moldy Arches in general as four or five stars there's something wrong with you and not in a good way either.  To quote Darrell Hammond as Sean Connery from Celebrity Jeopardy:  \"Boy, you might be legally retarded.\"\n\nWith that out of the way let's talk about the \"museum\" itself.\n\nSure some of the displays were neat with the sauce gun that looks like a Nascar pit crew could have used it to grease some ball joints and the displays with the different packaging & advertisements that were a nice trip down memory lane but not at the expense of getting too close for comfort with other people eating since the displays and actual eating tables are awkwardly too close together..\n\nIn the end what they offer really is NOT a museum and to use that name is at best a misnomer and in reality is probably closer to false advertising.  Sure there are some unique nuggets of info that you will ooh and aah over but by-in-large it's a waste of time especially considering how much hype/advertising exists making it sound like there is more here than there really is.\n\nOh and by the way, obviously it is still a functioning McD's.  While I'm sure most would eat here no problem we were skeeved beyond belief at the filth factor.  Upon entering the first thing I noticed was not the giant Big Mac buried back in the play area so as to  almost be hidden, no I noticed that all three of the front garbage receptacles were over flowing with trash.  Upon a quick trip to the bathroom let's just say that it wasn't exactly any better in there either.\n\nSo no, we did not partake in a Big Mac at the Big Mac museum and no we were not wowed by what we saw.  Thankfully we were in and out in under ten minutes but it's ten minutes that I wish I could get back to do something more creative with like.....fall off the roof of my house into a pool of dull razor blades."}
{"text":"It's as good as any McDonald's will be.  I only ate here because the person driving wanted to eat there.  On cool thing is they have the Big Mac museum inside of this one."}
{"text":"First! \n\nThe worlds biggest big mac statue is here! \n\nThe End."}
{"text":"The \"museum\" is lacking. There's a big mac time line and some mc d and big mac stuff behind glass, i think my personal collection is almost as big... There a kid's play area and an over sized big mac statue in the play area. Where they have random scary jungle sounds of lions roaring and monkeys screeching, definitely doesn't really fit with the rest of the restaurant's decor. I can see it scaring some kids."}
{"text":"Typical McDonalds. Just some signs around. Pretty uneventful. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"Avoid. Went through the drive-thru, was not given any receipts whatsoever & of course order had 3 wrongs items even after they were confirmed following the order. They want me to drive back to the store for a \"free replacement meal\", yipee!! Only reason this franchise is still in business is their location."}
{"text":"Just a bit of advice. If you are going to make someone wait for their food out in the parking lot at least make sure it's hot and fresh. I waited almost 10 minutes for a hot n spicy, 2 mcdoubles and a burrito. When I started eating the hot n spicy it was tough and cold. This location obviously does not care about their customers."}
{"text":"If I could leave zero stars I would. When I first walked inside and saw the interior I thought this was going to be a good McDonald's but the food definitely said otherwise. When we got our food it was as cold as can be, got an attitude when we asked for some fresh food. They were more interested in socializing with each other then with customer service never coming here again"}
{"text":"This is the worst location I have ever been to. The 1 star reviews are spot on. I refused to go there again after watching and employee (Men room) coming out of the bathroom stall and walk right out of the bathroom and go right back to work without washing his hands. I won't even get into the waits and screwed up orders I have received here. The wife gave them another chance. That will not happen again. Slow rude service with smart remarks and then nothing but excuses from the manager. Shouldn't take over 5 minutes for 2 ice creams when the store is almost empty inside."}
{"text":"I should have checked yelp before coming here. I have the app you would think I would use it more regularly. Slow poor service. The drive-through was backed up so bad employees were running orders out the front door. We dined in. Only ordered two happy meals. It took 15 minutes to get them. Food was all over the floor behind the counter. Employees generally had a lack of urgency and just acted like it was a normal evening."}
{"text":"Very bad experience for me and my son tonight. We just wanted Oreo McFlurry, but we had to wait for 25 minutes on the drive thru, very very slow service. It's 8:00 pm, it's not even peak hours. No acknowledgement, no sorry, no warning, nothing! My advice to you is to go somewhere else, clearly this mcd does not care about the value of your time."}
{"text":"What I don't understand, is how there haven't been any changes in quality of service after YEARS of bad reviews of this location. This McDonald's location is the only one I avoid. Service is ALWAYS slow, and there's a 98% chance that your order will be wrong. I have 3 little ones, and they love going to McD's as a treat every now and then. I will drive them to a different McD's that's out of my way, just to avoid the annoyance and frustration I feel going to this location. I feel like the staff even thinks it's a joke to keep customers waiting. There's never a sense of urgency, or even an apology when you've been waiting in line 10 minutes for a Diet Coke. You would think after all these horrible reviews, they would try and find a new manager and staff. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I've ever received. My 3 kids and I stopped here today. Line was pretty long but not horrible. \n\nWe ordered 2 sausage mcmuffins, 2 breakfast burritos, 2 plain mcdoubles and an iced coffee. \n\nPaid and pulled to 2nd window. The guy said \"we just dropped the hash browns in the fryer can you pull around front?\" I informed him that we did not order hash browns and he said ok and closed the window. A few minutes later he comes back and says: \"we are still waiting on your food can you pull around front?\" No big deal right?\n\nWrong! 15 minutes later a lady comes out with 2 bags of food. She asks: \"you had the hash browns...?\" Nope. 5 minutes later a different lady comes out dressed like she may have been a manager. She actually had our food. But....no iced coffee. I informed her that we had been here for a half hour by this point. My receipt said 10:28 AM and it was now 10:55. She went back in and got the iced coffee. Took a few minutes but our order was complete! No apology. Not even a hint of a smile. \n\nNeedless to say they took the \"fast\" out of fast food. Over 30 minutes for 5 food items and 1 iced coffee. If they had the option for 0 stars this McDonald's deserved it. I'll be finding a different McDonald's or somewhere else when we need \"fast food.\""}
{"text":"Place was filthy, service was really slow, trainee on cash register with no assistance from management.\nBad, bad, bad, someone from corporate should visit this place.\nI feel sorry for the trainee and franchisee this place is a disaster, order got goofed up, was supposed to be dine in and got a to go bag. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Came in at 6 am. Drove through the drive through first to even see if they were open. They were! I went inside and they said I was drunk and to get out, refused me service and were very rude. I had not been drinking, I am 19 years of age and was heading to work at Target with my uniform on. The manager with the tattoos on her arms said she would call the police if I ever came back because I was \"crazy stupid for going through a drive through and deciding to come inside\". I hope this place falls through just because of this incident. I called corp and let them know."}
{"text":"It's one of the few places in the area that is open late. Staff is the best I have ever seen at any McDonald's in my \nLife.....and I've traveled the country! \n\nOne morning I ordered only a large water, expecting to pay 50 cents or something, and they gave it to me for free, large and filled with ice. In Arizona, you learn to appreciate that..."}
{"text":"Drive up is fine but such a nice interior so little one wants to go inside alot. Ugh big mistake. no service, no Ice, no ketchup, carbonation/syrup combination is always screwed up, really nasty tables.  Folks have to clean their own table, I watched this as I waited for my food.  Too bad because you want to sit down and enjoy this location.  Last visit we quickly ate and instead of ordering dessert we left to eat at Dairy Queen.  quick in/out through drive through maybe but will never go back in. Management is never ever visible,  stuck in office it seems filling out crappie paperwork or playing Angry Birds."}
{"text":"Mango Pineapple Smoothies - like crack... without the nasty side effects!!\n\nThey forgot my straw - and 5 min wait to make a smoothie.... when I was the only one in drive-through? Booooo"}
{"text":"This McDonalds has probably one of the slowest drive throughs ever. The other day I was waiting in line and I didn't move at all for at least 7 minutes. It shouldn't take 10 or more minutes at a fast food place to get food. This has happened to me more than once. I do not at all recommend coming here if your trying to go somewhere fast."}
{"text":"Horrible. Management should be ashamed of themselves for the circus they are running.  19 mins in the drive thru for a drink. Order is never correct. Kids working there are clueless and are more focused on socializing with each other. I will be driving to another McDonald's. This place is seriously a Joke."}
{"text":"Service sooooooo poor!!!! Stopped this morning, 6/25/13. Manager looked at me, and even didn't come to window!!!!! What time they open? 5 am? Well I was there 5:10!!!!!"}
{"text":"Only got one star because I had too..this place is horrible..for one it's so dirty everywhere, fries on the floor..crumbs and every single table and the floor..don't even want to place my baby in the high chairs because they gross..witnessed a black lady(manager it seemed) she was in a blue shirt being rude to a guest and her young teen employee..then joking around with the others in the back like people weren't waiting long enough to order and there wasn't work or CLEANING to do..they messed up order by order and then I witness what seems like the store manager(Denise) was coming out reprimanding her drive through team for something loudly in from of guests..maybe if she wasn't sitting in her office her team would be working instead of goofing off and leaning on things..someone should tell her the motto \"if you have time to lean you have time to clean\". There is a much too long wait to even order your food and when ours came out the only thing hot was my daughters chicken nuggets, our fries were cold..my burgers were cold..then I overhear Denise saying to the cooks that she's asked for the cinnamelts twice and that they need to pull them out a few seconds early..imagine what else they are doing that too..this place is sad and corporate should really come and put their foot down..on top of all of that I saw quite a few guests walk in from messed up drive through orders in a short time.."}
{"text":"I agree with the others, slow service, wrong order, and unkept. How hard is it to do 2 hamburgers and to make sure the kids meal drinks are in the meal??? Where's a kiosk when you need it? Step up your game or get replaced by technology. At least I got an apology."}
{"text":"Typical McDonald's food but manager was yelling at employees in front of customers. It was making everyone uncomfortable."}
{"text":"This one has never been the place to go if you want to experience good customer service, but its the closest to us and unfortunately the kids like it. \nBut our trip yesterday but a end to it. We took the kids and after a painful ordering time with a very rude cashier we go to find a nice big hair in our cheeseburger (and defiantly wasn't one of ours) we took the uneaten cheeseburger to the manager which she didn't even apologize for it, in fact she didn't say anything until my husband ask if we can get the money back for the cheeseburger and she then said yes."}
{"text":"Only 2 things bring me to McDonald's, the coffee and.cheap desert. I do give credit for McDonald's on how they operate like a machine. They get you in and out, but unfortunately not this one. 10 minutes for a cup of coffee? Only 4 tables in the place and every single table got up to complain about their food quality, missing food etc. Where's management? Obviously they didnt graduates from hamburger u."}
{"text":"So tired of this place!  ALWAYS get our orders wrong, food is cold, old and sloppy... and the staff and MANAGER (tonight) was so rude!  My daughter went up to get our order fixed (the manager was not happy with her for bringing it back), then came home and found a FEATHER in her french fries!!!!!  NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN!!!  DISGUSTING!!!!  No more tries!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Ordered the sausage muffin with egg for $3.33 deal. Sub egg whites and had to pay full price, mind you I order it this way all the time. I questioned the price and was told that's the way it is and the guy walked away. Now I had to wait about ten minutes to get 2 sandwiches. I think I had the shortest wait, unbelievable."}
{"text":"Absolutely HORRIBLE service! Waited in the drive thru for 10 mins. Then told to pull up in front of the store to wait to for my food. Which by the way all parking spaces are full. I wait for close to 15 mins before I park in a spot that opens up and walk in to ask about my order. (The person in line ahead of me had to do the same)It had got forgotten about. Sad thing is this isn't the first time I've had such horrible service and I don't go there too often. Only when I'm getting my kids a happy meal as a special treat. Definitely the last time they will have my business."}
{"text":"Sat in line for 10 minutes in the drive thru only to be told that they can't take my order due to technical problems. I would have to come inside to place my order. How can you come inside when there are cars in front of you and behind you. Cat in front of me got an order. No one even opened up the first window to say anything to me. After a total of 22 minutes being trapped in the drive thru line, I will not be going back. To many other choices to get that kind of service even when there is a technical issue. Posting here since no one would talk to me in line."}
{"text":"I'm about a twice a year McDonalds guy.  I'll occasionally stop for coffee or an ice cream cone at the drive through but I rarely go inside.  The first Mickey D's urge of the year hit us this weekend and we decided to have lunch.\n\nI've been in this McDonalds a couple of times.  Honestly, it's one of the nicer ones around, probably anywhere. Very nice tables, nice stone flooring, great color scheme, you get the message.  My one complaint every time I'm here is that the drink/condiment area is an absolute disaster! Complete disgusting mess!  They do a pretty good job of keeping the tables bussed and clean but always forget about the condiment area.  The ketchup dispenser is either out of ketchup or such a mess that you don't want to use it and the little cups for the ketchup are either out or you have to dig them out of the holder with a tweezer.  One last request, any chance you could offer sweet and low for the ice tea? (It's the pink packet)\n\nI had the new grilled chicken bacon clubhouse sandwich. Honestly, it was terrific!  For once it actually looked exactly like the picture and was put together with some pride of ownership.  It was delicious! The fries were hot and fantastic which is good because they have a half life of about 19 seconds so I scarfed them as fast as I could.\n\nThe counter staff was nice and we got our food relatively quickly, overall, a nice place to have a quick fast food lunch."}
{"text":"My son's request for his birthday was \"Old McDonald's\"  so since my wife refuses I sucked it up and came here Saturday.  I am not a fan of McDonald's or a fan of what it represents, I have respect for Ray Krock but that is about it and I am not sure he would be proud of what he serves today either.  I hope the franchisee doesn't hate me for this review but since McDonald's targets kids with its toys (I know I used to love to go to this place too as a kid) then it gives me no choice but to speak the truth because I am a loyal Yelper that has kids.  My children of course ordered chicken nugget happy meals so they can get the stupid toy.  I made them get the apples and apple juice.  I had not been here in so many years that I noticed an Angus burger that was now on the menu and looked good in the picture.  Of course it was dry and bland, the fries here are always good but I have since learned that they are not exactly 100% potato so there you go.  I pretty much felt like crap when I left but I wanted to not keep my kids always wondering about this place with the desire to go inside.  Next time if he makes the request I will buy a slice of pizza from Barro's across the way and just eat that while my kids eat here.  Sorry McD's your food doesn't do it for me."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero..\n\nSons kindergarten graduation today and of all things, he wanted a chocolate dipped cone from McDonald's. \n\nWe order them and about 8 minutes later, I ask where the cones are. The 12 year old at the counter says oh... Then asks his manager to make them because he \"hates\" making them.... DO YOUR JOB YOU SPOILED POS!!!!\n\nAfter the child wins that battle... The rest of the team was so incompetent, that no one could dip a cone into chocolate to get it done.  Because no one has the iq of dead cockroach...they asked if we wanted something else. Said no and let the wife deal with it. Ridiculous and embarrassing...."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick meal and was treated with some of the best service I've had in a fast food restaurant. The clerk was quick and upbeat and even brought me over my food at the drinking station. While witnessing who was clearly the manager, I was inspired to see them speak to their staff with such respect and positivity."}
{"text":"When McDonald's made the decision to make their breakfast available all day long, they got me back after more years than I can remember.\n\nI've had some not good and some so-so experiences with the different locations around the Valley.\n\nThis location is one of the most pleasant experiences I've had in a McDonald's ever. The restaurant was clean. The staff were friendly and focused on work. The ticket time for 2 sausage McMuffins with egg was fast. \n\nIt was like what going to McDonald's 30 years ago was like. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been to this particular McDonald's location twice now. Each time they have forgotten to give me my sauce for my McNuggets. Of course this was after I left that I noticed, and eating nuggets without any sauce just isn't the same."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Phoenix in 2006 I was so moved by the exemplary service and high quality of McDonald's food at this location that I wrote an email letting them know how I feel. I felt this was the best served, freshest tasting McDonald's food I had experienced and the staff was always great and professional. Because of my praising email, they mailed me two free extra value meal coupons. Very nice. All McDonald's should be like this one. \n\nI recognize it is weird reviewing chains (especially a McDonald's), but this one I feel deserved it. Still don't like it? Tough."}
{"text":"Outstanding service at this Mickey D's!!! There is a manager or owner who really cares about his customers! Treating them as if they were at a fine dining establishment. The food is always fresh and the French fries are always hot & crispy!! Keep it up, you guys are doing great!!! Thank you for the great experience, every time."}
{"text":"No Shamrock Shakes!!!!! This was stop number 2 on our hunt to find shamrock shakes well before they should stop carrying them (1 week before St Pattys day). They claim to be \"out of the mix today\". Right, we have heard of that before. In any other business someone would get fired for not buying enough to meet demand. What is McDonalds problem???"}
{"text":"I wanted to share an update about this McDonalds because the Manager Obviously cares about what folks are saying. I was presented with a number of Coupons and a letter apologizing for the bad service. Since then I've there a couple times and my order has been taken and provided without ANY FLAWS!!\n\nGreat job and KUDOS to the Mangers for fixing all issues."}
{"text":"There was an obvious service and training issue at this McDonald's this morning.  The young lady at the register was polite to customers but had to keep apologizing for how long the orders were taking.  It was taking about 10 to 15 minutes to get your order.  Moments later she couldn't figure out how to fix a drink machine behind the counter.  I ordered a sausage biscuit, apple pie, and a large coke.  I had to wait about 15 minutes for my order.  My order came to $3.35.  I always get the same order for $3.01 at the McDonald's on Scottsdale Rd. and Shea.  I don't think I will go back to this location due to the wait times and higher prices.  I didn't see anyone working there who appeared to be an adult.  At least I didn't find worms in my sandwich like the two moms did recently in Draffenville and Mayfield, Kentucky."}
{"text":"I'm definitely not a regular at McDonalds but I was craving a large fries on a Tuesday night after a night of drinking. I can tell you that no one in the world has treated me with amazing customer service like the clerk did before. I actually want to thank Montell (I believe that's the name of the person who helped us) for how great he was, and I want to say that little things in life that matters. Thank you McDonalds and thank you Montell for the great drive through service that we've had."}
{"text":"Why a one star review? Food is predictably McDonald's so not taking that in consideration in my rating. What struck me here is the overall unfriendliness of the place. This is a decent size restaurant and at the time we went there on Tuesday morning this week, I noticed there were only two customers and a handful of McDonald's employees sitting about. The first thing I noticed was a sign stating that you were welcome to be in the restaurant for only 30 minutes while you were consuming food. I had stopped there in between meetings and had an hour to kill. What an inviting policy. Secondly, I walked up to the counter twice in the less than 30 minutes I was there to order drinks, and then later something to eat. Twice I was made to feel that my standing there was a nuisance to the counter staff. Sigh, can I help you, sigh,.... I also tried accessing the wi-fi offered at the restaurant and it was so insanely bad I could not even bring up my email due to the throttled connection. After about 20 minutes we left and went to a different place in the neighborhood that understands hospitality and customer service. Won't be back....."}
{"text":"I was on my way to work and I forgot to get breakfast so I decided to get the 2 egg McMuffin with sausage for 3.33 with a large Dr.Pepper (because I needed caffeine). I went through the drive-thru and when i ordered I ordered 2 sausage egg McMuffins and having bad hearing i could not hear the response with the price. I turn the corner and was greeted to a rude hello with the cashier saying \"We are switching drawers wait two seconds.\" I do not know what I did to put her in this attitude but I'm sorry. (not really get over yourself) I gave her my card and she swiped it without telling me the price or anything. While i sat waiting for the car in front of me to get their food and drink i looked at the receipt nd saw that they charged me for 2 regular retail sandwiches and not the special that they advertise. When I ask the gentleman at the next window, who was a little more pleasant, what the pricing was he told me he would get his manager to discuss. The manager was a little short of useful. She told me that a sausage egg McMuffin and an egg McMuffin was two different kinds of sandwiches. That really did not make me excited. \n\nSince this visit, I've stopped going to McDonalds. I hate to be the guy who points out every problem, but this was ridiculous. Hopefully, they can get their act together by the next time I go back."}
{"text":"Not really sure why everyone are giving this place a bad review.  I don't usually rate chain stores, but since they offer a lot of choices under the $1 menu for people on the move, I usually just get those items.  I get fast services every time I go there, it's hot cheap food for less.  Always the correct orders unlike most of the people giving bad reviews here."}
{"text":"The evening neglect to service is a recurring challenge at this location.  I sat in the drive through un acknowledged, way to long before finally  pulling up to the window, hoping to place my order.  No greeting or apology for this, only asked what I wanted. I asked the attendant if they were short handed this evening , and his response, it's only him that does everything at this late hour (about 9:30pm).  He then grabbed my debit card,   Failed to thank me ,or bother to issue me a receipt.  I believe he was a shift manager, had a tattoo on his neck.  Day shifts are well orchestrated , It's a shame the evening challenges are a a common occurrence."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 3 stars but the drive through line was about 12 cars deep, so we went inside.  It took 10 minutes to get our food after ordering.  Coulda been a bad night or a bad time (9:30pm) but this isn't the first time the lines have been really long here.  \n\nFood is normal, wait is not."}
{"text":"This McDonalds seems to have a good crew. Stopped to have breakfast and the food was hot, fresh, and served with attention to detail. There was a loitering issue in the parking lot but that was immediately addressed when notified. Chandra, the manager, seemed to go out of her way to be friendly, warm, and give excellent customer service. We need more people like her working for the public to brighten people's day as they start the work day."}
{"text":"This McDonald is renovated again. It is always packed,  drive thru is slow, difficult parking arrangement and currently impossible to drive and park. I cant even count how many times my order has been messed up here. A complete disappointment."}
{"text":"Why do I keep going here? It's awful.  Especially the drive thru.  Don't EVER take the inside lane at this McDonald's.  I lost my patience once a while ago and backed out, thanks to the car behind me letting me out.  Today, they took 10 orders in the outside lane to my one, I waited 15 minutes before I was able to order and by that time I could not back out.  There should be a law against entrapment in a drive thru lane at a fast tood chain.  So I complain to the order-taker, she apologized but gave no explanation.  Nothing changed since the last time I had attempted to get a meal at this location.  Then I grabbed my card back from the order-taker, she knew I was upset.  So she leaves the station for some reason.  The food-giver was laughing, I took my order.  When I got home, my quarter pounder with cheese was dripping saliva, my Coca-Cola had little floaties in it and my fries were soggy, she had some how went back and spit on my food!  I really need to report this to the police and the health department, I have proof with my bag of food and drink.  I will have it tested and present a lawsuit to this business for the inconvenience of attending their restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Terrible customer service, and they don't know how to run the drive thru. Super disappointed that my kids didn't even receive their kids meals after 10 minutes of no help."}
{"text":"I like this McDonald's it's big spacious clean and it had good wifi. Thanks McDonald's"}
{"text":"I LOVE this McDonalds! Awesome service, friendly smiles & great tasting food. I alter every order I make here (b/c I'm picky) and it's ALWAYS correct, I never have to send it back or go in from the drive thru b/c it's wrong. \n\nI have been coming to this location for probably 2 years and I've seen staff promoted and it's so awesome. I can't say enough good things about this mcdonalds. Keep up the great work you guys!!! :)"}
{"text":"The costumer service was horrible and they argued with us over them forgetting to give us 2 items that we ordered that we were charged for. There was a employee I believe was a manager who had her 3 year old son behind the counter and running all over the restaurant. Very unsanitary and unprofessional. I suggest going to another establishment that's suitable to eat."}
{"text":"It's McDonalds.  1 out 8 eat at McDonalds everyday.\n\nThis place was recently remodeled and they did a nice job."}
{"text":"I think they are just hiring anybody that wants a job. I went through drive thru and was greeted in a very unprofessional manner. Arrived at the first window and all I could hear are teenage kids yelling and the guy that was taking our payment joining them in their yelling and howling. Makes me wonder how our food was made."}
{"text":"Average location in every way. Clean. Busy corner location with not the easiest access into and out of. Otherwise it will do."}
{"text":"If I could ever post a zero star, I would do that without a second thought. Line was long, order was taken incorrectly, my receipt was thrown away by the staff after payment, a terrible visit and a big NO to this place."}
{"text":"I visit this McDonald (Warden-7) regularly mostly for their coffee and because it is on my way to work. The Branch 5 minutes away at McCowan and HWY-7 seems to operate much better and I think it is the management. The managers at (11787) does not smile ever nor do they greet but that is not an issue for me. The issues are: 1) the coffee is often served dripping on the outside and with no napkin offered (drive through). 2) The breakfast sandwich is not properly armed and is soaked in oil. The same sandwich (Egg McMuffin) at the McCowan location is served perfect and of course the staff at that location always pleasant and smiling! Other issues are the drive through management. Always slow at (Warden-7) location. Once there was no lineup and still they had me sitting in the cold waiting for the drive-through speaker to be attended. They installed two speakers in-a-row which makes it more confusing as there seems to be no sequence to when they both function in a line-up."}
{"text":"Busy location. The drive through lineup usually backs onto the street. I tend not to idle my car while waiting for the drive through, so I park and go in. Generally, it is a bit faster, but this location seems to be understaffed. Overall, there is plenty of seating, and you can get your own drinks from the fountain pop section. Don't go on coupon days because the wait to get served will be long! You could easily wait 15-20 minutes to get served! Overall, the food is the standard for McDonalds."}
{"text":"Slow service Inside or drive-through. Super busy here. Locals seem to love it - especially busy if the weather outside is sunny and nice.\n\nGenerally appears unclean. Bathrooms are usually disgusting. Not cleaned enough or the customers are gross.\n\nWiFi for Internet rarely works. Usually unable to connect."}
{"text":"To all the McDonalds I been, this is the only location have no drink station in the lobby, that's weird consider at least 99% of them have them"}
{"text":"Not too bad after all...\n\nFree Wifi \n\n$1 Medium Iced Coffee\n\nLeaf Payoff action showing on 2 TVs\n\nIf there's power outlets!"}
{"text":"The way the menu changes to a digital advertisement screen and back again is so cool! This is a nice McDonald's, so clean and neat. They sell lobster roll, poutine, nanaimo sundaes on top of regular McD menu items."}
{"text":"Worst place to get some ... Messed up my order multiple times even after confirming order with cashier.  But congratulations on annoying me enough to write a review about it *claps*"}
{"text":"Self-order is convenient. Noticed manager asking a seated Asian woman repeatedly whether she as waiting for someone. I suppose because she hadn't ordered anything, and appeared to be just sitting and using the free wifi. It's funny though that she did not similarly pester the white business woman working on her laptop a few tables away, also order-less. Just sayin."}
{"text":"Dropped by here tonight for dessert. My kids wanted a smoothie and this location doesn't serve them. I understand that the smaller ones don't have a McCafe but this is a proper store. Doesn't  even have a help yourself drink fountain. \nPlace was dirty too, litter all over the floor.\n\nWould not come here again, unless I was desperate."}
{"text":"Have been here numerous occasions morning noon night, its been ok. Surprised to see many negative reviews.\nFood could be a little hotter, I like hot steamy food.\nUsually go drive thru\nUsually friendly service\nUsually prompt\n\nOne time I was next in line, attendant asked me to hold on for a bit it was extra busy. I waited a while, was saying hello and 2 cars started honking at ME... As if I was holding them up in the line I just kinda waved my hand to say \"what, Its not me\", someone came out their car and asked if I was still waiting and I said YES. Because there were no cars in front of me. \nI still went ahead to order my food, I was starved. The attendant then told me someone just got fired because they couldn't handle the job and apologized.\nNo I didn't get my food free but it was certainly an after thought driving away :p\n\nApart from that dramatic situation they treat me well. I wish the food was a bit more fresh and steamy!"}
{"text":"Food is standard McD food, quality and freshness.  No surprise here.  Free WiFi is nice.  The storefront and washroom are clean though not sparkling so.  \n\nHowever, I love the genius location: corner of 2 of the busiest streets in Markham, plus it is on the way to both Hwy 404 and Hwy 407.  Whatever rent the owner is paying, it is worth it.  Drive through is fast in the morning, so don't let the long line up scares you.  The servers at the drive through windows are efficient and polite.  I am not sure how the meals and coffee become ready as soon as my car arrives at the 2nd window.  \n\n3 stars in general, but the efficient service at drive through during morning rush hours pushes the rating to 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"McD's is a special treat for us and I order some weird stuff.  I order a Jr Chicken dressed like a Mac with triple mac sauce.  I am often disappointed as they don't put triple mac sauce... this burger from this location last night (Aug 6 2016) was the best I have EVER had.  I will be dreaming about it for months.  I wish I knew which employee made it so I could give them a hug! lol"}
{"text":"This is the mcDs I come to whenever I'm hung over or ready to go out. Food quality is pretty consistent but can be slow at times. Always busy during the morning rush, so coming another time unless absolutely necessary!"}
{"text":"I'll gladly admit I prefer the coffee at McD's rather than Tim Hortons. Service is quick and efficient EVERY SINGLE TIME and a medium coffee is about the same price. It's a win/win. \n\nI'm in and out before other people know I'm there."}
{"text":"It is what it is its crap cheap food but they have free wifi which I love"}
{"text":"They are very slow and made 2 mistakes on my burger twice! When I ask for no cheese and really emphasize that you can't eat the \"processed cheese\" they use, it turns out they still make mistakes. I live about a 5 minute drive from the McDonalds, and when you use the drive thru and don't want to drive back to the restaurant to correct the mistake, I end up scrapping the cheese off my meat.\n\nThe Fries are always cold, drive thru or not. It seems impossible to get steaming hot fries like the old days. \n\nMcDonalds will remain McDonalds, but the do need improvement."}
{"text":"It takes a lot for me to write a bad review!...I have a business and I know that you can have an off day from time to time..\n\nThat being said, this location has screwed up my drive thru order the last 4 times!\n\nAt this point I am done with his location.\n\nIf you are a person who likes to customize your order, this location is not for you!\n\nManagement needs to overhaul this place!"}
{"text":"It seems the staff here have made a huge improvements recently.  They smile and are polite. Perhaps they let some of the staff go. If so, that was wise. A few months ago, everytime I came in there was incompetence or lack of care. On one occasion,  a lady seemed to be babysitting her granddaughter while working and laughed about her neglectful, wasteful service mistakes."}
{"text":"I have never gotten the correct order here, and the DT wait is horrendous. I go there weekly to buy ice & I often wait between 7-12 minutes in the drive-thru line. Inside is usually overrun by unsupervised 13 yr olds."}
{"text":"It's a mcdonald's. What else to say? It's what you'd expect: delicious food, really quick service and friendly people working the registers. Also a really high-quality atmosphere for a Mcdonald's, not the usually plastic look and feel, it actually seems like a real nice restaurant."}
{"text":"The manager always seems to be in a unpleasant mood and the wait time is ridiculously long. Compared to other McDonald's, I would expect much better customer service and competence."}
{"text":"Definitely they worst McDonalds I've been to in my life. Between horrible drive thru speaker noise, wrong orders, and unpleasant service it just amazes me that they keep it open. I actually drive right past it to the other location on 40th st if I need  McDonalds. Do yourself a favor and let this place close like everything else nearby."}
{"text":"Employees complaining about you for a custom order when you drive up, take over 8 minutes to bring it, act offended again when you tell them that they got the order wrong, and then hesitate to correct the problem. The sad part is we have run I to similar problems with this location several times."}
{"text":"Whenever I go here I have a good experience. While it's still fast food, it's made well, the restaurant is clean and neat, and the service is fast. They also have a nice play area for kids to hang out and have fun while eating. Overall much better than your average McDonalds"}
{"text":"McDonalds what do you expect.  It's reasonable price for the quality of food you get.  You can't eat this food every day but in a pinch it will work."}
{"text":"Great place to eat if you want a salad with a 4 DAY OLD expiration date on it.  Bought 2, got them home for the kiddos and they were BROWN.  Checked dates on bottom, one was 4 days PAST expiration date, the other 2 days PAST expiration date.  One I can see, two speaks of sloppy safety and food handling services.  Called the phone number on receipt to alert them so no one else paid for expired crap, but no answer.  Surprise.  Decided to drive all the way back.  Their 17 year old 'manager' did not seem real concerned, so he got a food safety lecture.  Ho hum, they don't care.  Maybe Az Dept. Health will.  Seriously, this one has put expired stuff in our drive through bag before and I let it pass. . . not this time.  Avoid this place like the plague unless you want . . . well . . . the plague."}
{"text":"Wake up management! These employees need help. I have been here three times over the last few weeks and employees are frantic and there are very long lines in drive thru. When I go inside, you see the employees working hard. Either McDonald's corp or the owner of this franchise need to pay attention! This is not the McDonald's standard. Btw, I do not feel that this is an employee issue as the number employees working seems small!"}
{"text":"The best in the business . Always spotless friendly fast and tasty. Good drive thru access and rite turn onto the highway."}
{"text":"Situated in the centre of Place Vertu.  Typical long lines during the weekends. Great if you have a small kids who are hungry in that its in the mall itself."}
{"text":"I have very limited dining options, coming here out of necessity.\n\nYou could do much worse, the interior is nice, there are a couple of outdoor seats.\n\nThey rarely run out of stuff (if ever), the lines are not that long and it's clean and serviceable.\n\nThe drive-thru can be quick at times, but can get bogged down, sometimes easier to just park and pick up."}
{"text":"When I'm in Place Vertu, I will sometimes stop off at the McDonald's in Place Vertu to get a light snack or a drink.\n\nDuring the summer, I was shopping in Place Vertu and I stopped by this McDonald's to get a $1 Summer Drink Deal. I lined up at the cash and paid for my drink not knowing what to expect since at some McDonald's (such as the one across the street from Cote Vertu metro station), I've been told to wait for my cup to fill up my drink while at other McDonald's, I've been given the cup immediately.\n\nAfter paying, I was glad to be given my drink cup immediately since there seemed to be a line of people waiting for their orders.\n\nI went immediately to the soft drink dispenser and filled up my cup and drank it in the McDonald's while I rested. At the time that I went there, this McDonald's was fairly busy but it wasn't as busy as 2 of the other McDonald's that I've gone to (like the one across the street from Cote Vertu metro and the one in Central Station downtown).\n\nWhile I was drinking my drink, I noticed that they did have a staff member wipe down some of the tables. After finishing my drink, I went for a refill as I normally do when I leave and didn't experience any problems doing so.\n\nThis McDonald's is in Place Vertu and has their own enclosed dining room so it isn't like a McDonald's stand in a food court but is an enclosed area where you \"enter\" the McDonald's. Of course you can always order take-out and then eat at the main food court. It is not in the main food court area but it is close enough to the main food court area that you won't be able to miss it. Since this McDonald's is inside a mall and not in a separate building, there is no \"children's play area\" in this McDonald's.\n\nThere is another McDonald's which is across the street from the Place Vertu mall near the La Cage.\n\nAs McDonald's go, I would give this McDonald's at Place Vertu 3.5 stars which I've rounded up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Typical McDonalds inside the mall. Fast, clean, courteous employees. Food was as one might expect here. Large seating area. Many seniors."}
{"text":"America:  if you search \"Healthy Restaraunts\" in Cornelius, NC in Yelp, McDonald not only comes up, it's #7!"}
{"text":"If I could i would one hundred percent rate this place zero stars but the lowest is one so here I go!!!\n\nAll my family HATES MCDONALD'S we have never had a good time there. Once we where driving to another state and we needed something fast so we pulled over to THIS McDonald's and we ordered food. I said the food stinks here so all I got was some yogurt. But I wanted a taste if the chicken more like chumken!!! And it was fishy and tasted so bad, I felt that I was gonna throw up!!! Then my dad took a bite if his bigmac all the sudden we hear gagging and gagging and my dad pulled a long long hair out of his mouth- He was grossed out and almost threw up! We should have NEVER expected more from a FAST FOOD restraint my dad still gags today when we speak of it!!!!\n\nNEVER go to McDonald's I heard there chicken is not even real chicken they out all sorts of pink goo and stuff that makes u sick!!! Before you EVER go to McDonalds remember what there food is doing to YOUR BODY. Eat a salad for once or eggs something healthy for once!!! America these days are FILLED with fast food- choose the right direction go the healthy way! McDonald's will never get you there nor Wendy's, or Pizza Hut, and especially KFC. If you want the right thing for your body make something healthy- a great place to go is Zoey's Kitchen they have AWESOME HEALTHY FOOD!!!! I promise you that once you start eating healthy you will feel better you will feel great! Look for healthy places you can go greasy foods won't make you feel good- egg salad will! Make your own egg salad there is so much you can do now to eat healthier!!! What do you have for dinner??? I good suggestion would be grilled chicken with green beans BE CREATIVE!!!!! Use your mind to do the right thing- and if you read this whole review then I hope this motivates you to eat healthy!!!!"}
{"text":"I came to this mcdonalds late on a Friday. Around 1230pm, I waited a decent amount of time at the drive thru which I didn't mind. When I finally got to the 2nd window a manager told me that my order didn't go through and they thought I left when there was just a long line to of cars! She also said I had to pay cash and they don't accept debit cards that late at night. She didn't make sense at all so I left and went to Wendy's!"}
{"text":"Not worth the effort.\n\nLast night (Saturday, April 2), I was driving home and wanted a little something to eat since I had skipped dinner earlier even though I had tried another fast food restaurant but that's another story.\n\nIn any case, this McDonald's closed to where I live and just off of Exit 28 on I-77 so I decided to give it a shot.  Already had made up my mind for a Filet of Fish Combo.\n\nPulled into the drive through and only one car ahead of me. Rest of the parking lot was essentially empty. Took awhile but I got to the order stations and placed my order. The other car was still ahead of me and they were taking their time at the first window as he was trying to pay for it.\n\nFinally got to the window and paid and pulled up.  Almost 5 minutes later and the car ahead of me is still waiting to pick up his order.\n\nPathetic\n\nEven though I had already paid for the order, i pulled out of the line and left. My time is more value to me than that and I'll just chalk this one up to experience and not go again.\n\nIf you are driving through on I-77 I would not recommend this store. There are a lot of other fast food restaurants at this exit and the next couple that will serve you in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"Worst in 20 years. Have Never had a bad egg mcmuffin until today. The bread was stale and burnt. The egg white was running and gross. Will not be back"}
{"text":"Two stars for service prior to my last visit.\n\nAfter getting food here from the drive-through on several occasions, I went inside one day.\n\nThe inside (floor, countertop where registers were) was not very clean and there were a lot of supply items (cups, etc.) that needed to be put away.\n\nI stood at a register and waited to be acknowledged. The teenaged staff was busy engaging in personal talk and laughing. One or two looked my way but no one offered to help me.\n\n*sigh*\n\nI won't return."}
{"text":"This McDonald's has the best lunch time drive thru staff ever! They're always super fast, accurate, and polite. And very friendly. \nThe great drive thru crew makes me come back, even though I only sort of like McDonalds. I know I won't have to check my bag before leaving and they always include the napkins/croutons/forks/whatever you should have. A nice break from the other drive thrus in this area."}
{"text":"Employees never smile. Counter staff is rude. Managers yell to get attention of employees. Maintenance guy smokes on the job and looks sloppy. He comes into building, leaves his cigarette burning outside and smells up the whole lobby like smoke. After they remodeled a few years ago, it hasn't been the same. Families don't come in. The new layout is horrible. Plus, they play church music on the radio all day. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Wish I could give negative stars. Horrible , horrible  customer service.  They need  some serious work.  Skip it an go to a different exit McDonald's"}
{"text":"This location must be the odd ball of the area because their prices are always higher than the other McDonald's around here. For instance, a large Tea at any other McDonald's is $1, at this location, $1.49. Same thing on their $1 Menu. Evidently the management is trying to run up some profits at the expense of the customers. Now, if you don't mind paying the extra money, you might rethink that once you visit the restrooms which were disgusting. Me, I will keep driving to the next one just a few minutes away before going back here."}
{"text":"Never have I experienced such rudeness from employees at our local Cornelius McD.  From the drive thru voice on the microphone to the young man collecting my money to the next women who basically thru my bag at me.  Has this franchisee not thought to hire and train their employees to be thankful for its customers. Without customers, you have no sustainable business.  This place has gone way down in the last year.  You should be ashamed of your location and the people who represent your business!"}
{"text":"I waited for 30 minutes for them to switch to my intercom while I watched 4 cars on the inside lane get service before I was to pissed off and left. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"I do not know if this location has gone through a management change, or what, but service has gone from very poor to excellent. The ladies working the drive thru lately are fast, friendly, and accurate! There's nothing worse than driving away to find out your Dr. Pepper is Diet Coke, or that you hamburger is chicken nuggets.\n\nI've never gone inside, other than to exchange what they gave me for what I ordered. But, they are going through an extensive renovation now."}
{"text":"While I was placing my order, the employee couldn't hear me well and asked me to speak up, so I had to almost yell. I ordered a sweet tea with my meal. When I reached the 2ND window I paid the cashier and then I was told to pull up because my fries were not done. At least 5-6 cars were able to get their orders before someone came out to with my food, at which point I was already on my way inside because I had noticed that my order said Un-sweetened tea. I had called the store's phone number listed on the receipt to try to let them know before the employee came out with my food, but no one answered after 10 rings on two separate calls. After I went inside to get my drink, the Manger proceeded to help with the drive thru orders instead of giving me the correct drink which I explained wad the reason I was on my way inside. She then gave me the wrong drink, which I didn't find out until after I had gotten back to my car. So I had to go in Again. Then she gave the wrong drink Again. I tasted it right there at the counter so she then corrected my drink and gave a half - assed apology. When I said thank you for my drink, she didn't even say you're welcome. Highly dissatisfied with this visit, which isn't even the worst one. (Received under cooked burgers on more than one occasion, wrong drinks, and onions/mustard even though the slip on the box said none were on there)"}

If there is a school night there - forget it.  They can't keep up with whose order is whose, the staff is not prepared for that load.  They never get orders right so I constantly have to appeal to a child who doesn't like mustard on their hamburger.  They are so ghetto - they give old toys in their happy meals - really?!  Like my kid is stupid and doesn't know what it is supposed to be thanks to ads, signage, and what not.  Please do yourself a favor and do not go to this McD."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is offset from the road a bit. Parking for dine-in or carry-out is quite convenient, but navigating into the drive through lane is a little tricky.  Watch out for people driving out as you try to enter.  Otherwise, it's a regular old McD's.  The staff were resonably friendly when I was there."}
{"text":"I read the reviews of this location & I would have to agree with most. The drive-thru seems to be where most if not all reviewers had problems, as have I. But, my experiences going inside have always been good aside from the one time broken soda machine. Today my breakfast burrito was a bit more filled than at other locations. Nice! Laura is a nice manager and the few conversations I've had with her have been pleasant. Phillip was taking orders again today & as in the past he was very nice. My order came out in a timely manner. 3 stars."}
{"text":"My son has been going there with his friends and though its different times of the day, he has been finding hair in his food. That's fucking disgusting. I hope this place goes out of business.\n\nMy family will never eat there again."}
{"text":"I like this McDonalds above all others because of one specific hard worker. Phillip. This gentleman is always super-polite and fast with his work. Yet not sloppy. He adds a pride to everything he does every single time I come in our go through the drive thru. I know workers come and go in the fast food industry. However this McDonalds is very lucky to have some one who cares for every customer and works hard. Job well done."}
{"text":"First time they served me oatmeal in a cup. Second time they have no hot chocolate and I still had to wait in the drive thru. Unsure why the management staff is unable to order the right amount of inventory. Im not giving a 3rd chance to be disappointed."}
{"text":"As far as McDonald's is a paragon of consistency and management by numbers, at least this location is consistent in getting our orders wrong. In my 30+ years of patronizing the franchise, this one location accounts for more wrong orders than all the rest combined. Management needs to educate here."}
{"text":"What would be cool is to actually order a Dr Pepper and receive a Dr Pepper. Every time I go through the drive thru I get s coke and not a Dr Pepper. Crazy how these people want to make more money but can't get a beverage right. Super annoying."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to mcdonalds, but after many bad experiences the past three times I've visited I will no longer be eating from here. The night people have been very abrasive lately, and today the day shift told me they wouldn't provide what I had asked for."}
{"text":"My first time to this McDonalds in....well, I cant remember.  The service wasn't horrid.  It was a bit slow even considering the line through the drive through.  Maybe I was just tired and grumpy....\n\nI am a bit annoyed that I asked for dips for my McNuggets and they gave me NONE.  Not the worst out there.  They may get another chance but I am far from wowed at this rate."}
{"text":"First, there is one young man at this store that often works order taking and window transactions who is exceptionally personable and conscientious.  Any other experiences I've had here have a 50/50 chance of failure. Three times I have taken my family to this McDonald's for ice cream in the evening only to find out their machine was broken. Today I went to pick up ice cream for my family was given a sundae, arriving home to find no nuts or utensils were included. As well, I purchased an ice cream cone in a cup that was about one-third of the normal size.  I have spoken to the manager here with no luck, i.e. we'll resolve it next time and that never happens. Too many times I've arrived home (2 miles away)with an incomplete or incorrect order. No pride in workmanship, product, quality or consistency and definitely no ownership. This is not rocket science. My advice, select other alternatives in fast food."}
{"text":"Apparently this location is gremlin friendly, cause after midnight they don't serve you; unless you have cash. Sure, gizmo is happy, but no one else is. What kind of huge fast food chain doesn't accept a debit card!? A communist one, that's who. They like to brag about all day breakfast, but only with exact change and a polka dance to go with it. Absolutely ridiculous establishment."}
{"text":"Great slides for the three year old; haven't had a service issue, beyond typical fast food worker apathy.\nOil needs to be chaned in the fryer. :-P"}
{"text":"Asked the guy in the drive through to repeat our order because it was wrong on the screen and we wanted to double check our order, he then seemed to get mad and said I can't take your order the system will be down for 2-4 hours. We asked him to talk to the manager and he then gave us the \"I am the manager\" line. We then went to the cvs next door and watched him give food to the people behind us!! Never been denied business for nicely asking a question! Didn't get the guys name but he was of middle eastern dissent. Went to jack in the box and received great service. No wonder McDonald's is struggling, piss poor service."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever, esp from 7pm onward. The lady asking us our order in the drive thru didnt know what chicken selects were or if they even served small drinks. I thought it was a joke or something until i got to the window to see one of the dumbest human beings in the world. She didnt ask me for my card, apologize for being rude/ignorant to her own menu, and just flirted with a co worker during the entire transaction. I know its minimum wage at a mcdonalds but Jesus wept this location needs better employees. As a manager of a retail establishment i was appalled at their customer service, and my wife was disgusted with their attitudes. At least the fries were luke warm."}
{"text":"Phillip is such a great employee! He always has a smile on his face and the positive energy just bounces off of him. He always remembers my name as well. I always hope he's there when I stop for my morning tea! He always compliments me somehow and it is a nice start to my day. Thanks Phillip! This store is so blessed to have you on their team! 5 stars for Phillip!"}
{"text":"The drive-thru cashier was not pleasant one bit, no smile, acted as if we were interrupting her life. She didn't care about taking my order. When I handed her my money, she glared at me like I did something wrong, she took her time counting the change in the meantime laughing and joking with other crew members and ignoring me. When she gave me my change, not even an effort at a half smile or thank you was given. I already questioned this order, but since my kids were hungry I kept my composure. Next, pickup window...the Manager didn't even acknowledge me, no genuine concern for customer service, or even a smile, she just tossed my kids happy meals and drinks and then just shut the window with a \"thank you\", or \"have a nice night\". That was the last straw, I pulled around, walked in and asked for a refund, still Maria the manager didn't give a care as to why I wanted a refund nor asked if there was anything wrong, she just took the receipt gave me my refund, walked to get a pen and just told me to write my name on a paper. Never have I ever had an experience like this abhorrent service."}
{"text":"Went to get my son a burger before he went to work. Unlike past reviews, I have never had a problem with the drive-through.  the orders are always correct and the service is always friendly."}
{"text":"horrible horrible horrible  customer service. the latino male manager on a shift is a blatant liar and refused to refund me for a $2.00 missing item even though i had the receipt. he claimed i was just trying to get free food.....yeah right.  i will call corporate and have the last laugh and dispute the entire order charge on my bank card. then, you'll get a $12+ charge back from the bank as opposed to just giving me my missing item.  what a real economics major and entrepreneur you are.....business strategy at its best!!"}
{"text":"Today (9/27/15) around 10:30PM, I was there in the drive through. The manager in this shift has pathetic customer service, and he does not honor corporate promotion. Specially, he treats teachers as disrespectfully and he denies all teacher appreciation promotion offered by corporate office of McDonald. As a teacher everytime I have to either pay extra or pay for the whole price of the products that I am supposed to be getting it free."}
{"text":"Never fails! Employees are friendly but I always have to pull forward to wait for my food/drink, something. It's not like I'm ordering anything out of the ordinary.... I'm don't understand that they don't know what they are doing. Fast food, really isn't that difficult. Orders have been wrong in the past and I think I need to drive farther to find a better McDonald's... I'm writing this review as I sit in the parking lot waiting on a smoothie. When we ordered, the employee said the machine was down, then corrected herself to say it was working. When the employee finally arrived at our car with the smoothie, NO STRAW! Gee, thanks. I'd give less stars but the employees are so nice."}
{"text":"IF you go here for lunch don't park in area that is continuation of the drive thru. \nOne person taking orders = a line that rapidly grows and a longer wait for something that shouldn't require a wait.\n The drive thru is typically the way I come through here and will be the only way from now on..."}
{"text":"The burgers are cooked magnificently, and the master chefs have a way with the salads that can't just be beat. I also thank them for posting that sauces cost 10 cents extra - most other McDonalds don't have signage saying sauces cost extra. They often close early on weekends to give staff members extra family time."}
{"text":"I highly suggest going to the McDonalds on McClintock and Elliot, aside from always getting my order correct and fill my soda all the way to the top but they also hire cashiers who know how to count change correctly. \n\nAt this location, there's countless times that the concept of fast food is waiting 20 minutes only to get stale bread, cold french fries and the genius giving change cops an attitude when you correct how much change he owes you. This location is in desperate need of a severe Ronald ass kicking! Shame on the management, can you even try to care about your customers."}
{"text":"All of the food was mediocre, and not that warm. Fortunately the staff was very nice. They forgot our cookies but quickly got them when I pointed it out. I was glad to see the supervisor helping others, and quickly cleaned up a spilled drink himself. The building is nice, with a good atmosphere. The toilets are really high and uncomfortable, though, and have an \"automatic\" plastic cover that doesn't even work."}
{"text":"How l love the food, atmosphere, staff AND owner!!! Fresh food, clean setting, relaxed fun for everyone Come here and enjoy a great meal along with fresh hot food. Oh the Owner is a real gentlemen and very sweet."}
{"text":"OMG! They're everywhere! Breakfast all day! $1 fountain drinks! Consistency, they name is fair. The fries were better when they used lard. Quarter Pounder with Mac sauce, extra lettuce, and reconstituted burger onions is a delicacy, but who has time for that? This place will straight kill you, and it probably won't be worth it. The chicken is funny tasting. Use at your own risk, like opiates and firearms."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a salad and the free Wi-Fi while my car is getting an oil change.\n\nThe building is very clean and was re-modeled a couple years ago.  It can get a little noisy, but I find most McDonalds are.\n\nThe employees here are standard friendly and are pretty fast and accurate.\n\nI find this location to be particularly busy.  Whenever I come here, there is always a line (regardless of stopping in the restaurant or pulling up in the drive-thru).\n\nOverall, it's just a nice McDonald's.  Good for a quick bite and casual ice cream with friends."}
{"text":"Nice location.  Usually very busy.  Parking lot is small, drive through is congested, but the staff gets you moving.  Overall, it's still a McD's, but if you feel the need, this is not a bad choice."}
{"text":"Love this McDonald's! The staff is always very friendly and efficient and the food is always fresh! The inside is always clean. If I am stopping at McDonald's- I will go out of my way to go to this location!!"}
{"text":"It's not always the cleanest dining room however the employees are friendly especially the manager . The fries are always fresh and hot too"}
{"text":"Im lovin it.....i go here for my ice cold fountain soda's. Sometimes when they are super busy the dining room can be a mess, but it isn't their fault with just two people working and Ten people waiting on orders."}
{"text":"They failed again who in the hell wants brake fast all day fuck that . We want lunch all day . I hate brake fast,  lunch is were it's at"}
{"text":"This is the McDonald's inside Walmart.  My husband and I have been having breakfast there 1-2 times a week for several years now.  They've recently completed a long overdue remodel which helped the dining experience tremendously.  The main reason they are only getting 2 stars is almost completely due to the counter person - who we think is the manager - a dark haired middle-aged man with glasses.  He has to be the most customer UN-friendly counter person ever!  He has to know who we are as all the other employees do.  Yet, not only doesn't he indicate he knows we are regular  customers, he doesn't acknowledge us in any way.  We aren't being singled out.  He doesn't acknowledge anyone.  He doesn't say \"hello,\" \"thank-you,\" \"good-bye,\" \"come again\" - nothing.  He never smiles or shows any emotion.  We see him as a very rude man and we actually think he is the manager!!\n\nMy other big issue is the price of the large iced coffee which continues to be $.50 cents higher (as of about a month ago or less) than the McDonald's at the Carefree Highway and has been for a long time.  I have no idea why as you would think being inside the Walmart, the McDonald's would have rock bottom prices, too - but, they don't.\n\nUsually, we are satisfied with our breakfast sandwiches, but they have been known to use stale English Muffins.   Until recently, they (especially the managers) skimped tremdendously on the cream in the iced coffees.  The other employees seemed to consistently make the iced coffees correctly but it was always the managers who were trying to \"save the cream.\"\n\nTrying to end this on a positive note, through the years there have been some excellent employees working there especially Elvira, who went to another McDonalds for awhile and is now back at the Walmart Mcdonalds.  \n\nI would love to give this more than 2 stars but that sullen, rude man working the counter just makes us not even want to go in there."}
{"text":"I waited like 20 minutes for a big mac meal! I thought its supposed to be fast food a perfect place to go when you need a quick lunch from work. Customers after me were getting there meals before me. And when I asked for Ranch the cashier gave me one little packet. Terrible service this time."}
{"text":"This McDonalds is pretty great when I get hungry at Walmart. It's kind of weird when you order to go they give you the food you order in a plastic bag. They always seem to be out of products. They tells me someone is not preparing correctly. Failing to plan is planning to fail."}
{"text":"We didn't realize that the GPS was sending us to a location inside a Walmart, but we decided to stay once we got there.  I'm wishing we hadn't.   We had breakfast.  The hasbrowns were really greasy.  The biscuit on my sausage biscuit with egg was dry and stale.  The sausage mc muffin was only ok."}
{"text":"I'm a Mclover, and I had no problem\nwith the workers. But I have a problem waiting more than 30 minutes for my cheeseburger. They weren't even busy! This was my first and last time at this location."}
{"text":"One of best McDonalds in Vegas, always very clean,, great service ,, close to the Las Vegas Strip..."}
{"text":"So I love McDonald's breakfast and we were on our way to the convention center for the Heli-Expo and I ordered my usual of one bacon egg and cheese biscuit, and one bacon egg and cheese McGriddle and they were great as usual.  The service was also quick and good. I don't understand the people that complain about the service or food from McDonald's what do you really expect.  Go somewhere else if you want better service, or literally go anywhere else but don't complain you know what you are getting yourself into.  \n\nAfter we sat down and got our food we noticed that one of the huge front windows was completely shattered.  It actually looked really neat and then we asked what happened they said that someone shot it the night before.   \n\nThe other nice thing about this McDonald's is it has free Wi-Fi for all of its customers."}
{"text":"I came here at 12:20, ordered a small mcfrappe (chocolate chip=amazeballs) and a sausage mcmuffin with cheese. Seems pretty simple, right? I didn't ask for any crazy special instructions, right?\n\nSo, after sitting there and waiting for 14 minutes.... yes, FOURTEEN MINUTES, they finally hand me my mcmuffin. I, regrettably, drove off without checking it first.\n\nGuess what? There's no cheese. So now I'm sitting in the drive thru line (which is now unreasonably long) instead of driving home. Yay me. \n\nI really don't understand it. Is it really that difficult to understand? And now they're trying to argue with me saying it doesn't come with cheese on it.... I know that, but I asked for cheese to be added....so.... am I wrong here? Lol Idk why they look so confused. \n\nPlease train these employees to have better customer service. No apology or anything, the girl just shoved the bag in my hand and shut the window. What a lovely bunch you have working here :)"}
{"text":"They were using profanity thru the drive thru speakers. No greeting sat in the drive thru for 20 plus minutes.  The older lady on grave reminds me of a meth head"}
{"text":"This McDonald's is horrible. Their employees are rude, and yea it's Mcdonalds, but the food was NASTY. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Omg bad service. I would never ever ever ever come to this place anymore. Whewww so rude, handling customer like whatever.."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the worst drive-thru. If you have 30 minutes to wait for your fast food to come out, this place is just for you."}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's ever!!!!!!! Do not stop here. The women's restroom is locked, but the men's restroom is open. What !!!!! While on the way to the LV convention center, I have to go use the restroom , but it was locked! I have to purchase before I can use it"}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I sit in the drive-thru. The wait has been worse than terrible. Children have died of starvation faster than this line is moving. But wait. It gets better. I'M NOT EVEN GETTING ANY FOOD. You see, they aren't accepting credit cards right now, cash only. They apparently thought it would be hilarious to wait to tell me this until I got to the ordering section when there were 9 cars behind me, and I couldn't back out of line. I mean, is making a sign that hard?"}
{"text":"Cold terrible cardboard on a bun, trashy service, homeless people drinking 24oz cans of Natural Ice inside the place!"}
{"text":"I came here now at 0352 hours hungry af I also am sober only disclose that cause well it is vegas. Anyways I ordered two cheeseburgers no pickles and an orange hi c. Well not only did it take approx 20 mins they still added pickles in addition I was the only car in drive thru."}
{"text":"I'LL HAVE ONE BREAKFAST MCMUFFIN, HOLD THE GUNFIRE\n\nIf you're in Vegas for an event at the Convention Center, you'll probably be up early enough for breakfast. If you're not there on work, you might just want to sleep through this part of the day. McDonald's breakfast is not sold nearly long enough. I never make it there on time! How hard would it be to serve eggs all day?!!  In any case, this McD's is convenient to the convention center.\n\nWe stopped here more than once on our last Vegas trip a couple months back. On one of the visits while dining in, we noticed a bullet hole in the window from the night before. Someone probably mad about breakfast not being served all day is my guess.\n\nService was good. Food was average. The coolest thing about this location was the deco. It was so modern inside. Clean and cool. I like that."}
{"text":"Went here to get some cookies for a friend. The drive thru person Lamoni, sucked and couldn't tell the difference from coffee to her asshole, also a car broke down in the drive thru."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly top 5 worst McDonald's in Las Vegas. The absolute worst and rudest staff I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. \"B\" at the counter actually had me bag my own food because she was too busy on her phone.  And they want $15 an hour!!?? What a FN joke"}
{"text":"It's hard to say that I now know what the \"worst McDonalds in the world\" is like but tonight I visited it. I have never in my life had McDonald's fries that at some level weren't good but these were a stale excuse for such an easy to make product. The chicken in both the nuggets and in my girl's sandwich were brown in color and over cooked would b a complement. \n\nDO NOT EAT AT THIS ONE... Sadly there is one literally two buildings away..."}
{"text":"Best mcdonald's ever, with an extensive secret menu! Ask for the McLobster, it's to die for. \n\nObviously I'm joking, that's not a real thing, but ask anyway. The food here is actually pretty solid, and it's pretty clean for the most part. As far as McDonalds goes, it's pretty nice."}
{"text":"I should have known better. I can count on one hand the number of times I've been to McDonald's in the past ten years. However, my choices were extremely limited so I thought I'd give it another shot. This visit was a reminder why I don't come here. It totally sucked!\n\n1. The staff was unpleasant.\n2. The fries were room temperature.\n3. The burger tasted vile.\n4. I have no complaints about the diet Coke.\n\nNext time I'll just go hungry."}
{"text":"Been in the drive  thru for 20 minutes  and still not at the window. Cars lined up to the street. At the window  finally. No hello. Just verified  order which was wrong. Only got the shake. No hamburger. Going on 25 minutes  now. They really  need some  help.  Too bad for the franchisee. They are losing  a ton of money."}
{"text":"I don't usually do reviews on fast food like McDonald's because I eat their fries maybe once every five months or so but let me just say. This McDonald's is horrible!!!! I literally waited 10 minutes just for someone to take my order and then another 15 to get them! When I pulled up I had to make sure they didn't have any salt on them just like I ordered them, but of course they didn't listen to me. Never coming back here again!"}
{"text":"By far the worst McDonald's I've ever been to.. I mean yeah it's a McDonald's but the service is terrible.. it took me more than 20 minutes to get my food, employees were playing around in the back while they had food orders.. I didn't get my full order that I paid for, didn't realize it until I got home.. the only reason why Im even giving 2 stars is for the effort the cashier gave to everyone. He actually tried to get orders in if they weren't being made.. and they're wondering why we find it outrageous that they're asking for 15$/ hr."}
{"text":"By far the worst McDonalds I've ever been to. I have been here a few times in the last two months as it is the only fast food place that is still open when I get off work late at night. Every time I've been there, they have been \"unable to provide a receipt and are cash only\". This is unacceptable, and this issue has not been addressed in months. I am writing this review while in the drive thru and have currently been waiting for 13 minutes for one sandwich and a drink, and there are still two cars in front of me. This place is garbage."}
{"text":"Completely incomprehensible order taking at speaker. After asking to repeat, finally figured out that they can't give receipts for credit or debit cards. No hi, how can I help you. Just a rapid blurt out of the receipt disclaimer. \n\nAll that and then the only thing we wanted (an ice cream cone) is of course unavailable and we are stuck in the drive through. No ice cream past midnight apparently? Should that even be allowed in 24/7 Vegas? Couldn't put that time requirement SOMEWHERE on the menu so people know? \n\nOh, and paint dries faster than the line moves. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"This place sucked! I ordered a sausage mcmuffin and the cashier was slow in making it. She even forgot the harshbrowns that were included in the meal. Also the ketchup dispenser sprayed everywhere and went on my shirt. The most dumbest stupidest mcdonalds i've been to. Avoid this place if u want to eat at a mcdonalds restaurant. There are better mcdonalds places than this one."}
{"text":"I typically don't go out of my way to write a review for a fast food chain. Hell, I hardly give one star reviews. Oh, but let me tell you about this McDonald's. This place has some of the worst service. \n\nWe came here around 7:00pm on a Sunday night and waited 40 minutes in the drive-thru. FORTY-MINUTES! I could have gone to the market, picked up some ingredients and made my own burger! We wanted to back-out and leave, but there was a line of cars behind us, honking, and furious just like me. All I wanted was my 2 ice cream sundaes and spicy McChicken. By the time we got to the window, they JUST started making our burger. My the time we got our sundaes it was a cup of melted ice cream soup. I couldn't even enjoy my sundae. Thanks Obama."}
{"text":"I agree with Douglas--this is one of the best McDonald's in Las Vegas.  I stopped here for a quick ice cream last night and I was immediately impressed with the newness and nice design of the place.\n\nThe staff took my order quickly, and I was on my way to a table very quickly.  The tables were clean and the restaurant was clean.  I was really impressed!\n\nThey have free wifi which is a nice bonus.  If I need at break some day and I'm in the area, I'll definitely stop again."}
{"text":"Was told at 5am that burgers arent made until 4pm by some chubby ogre latina.\n\nStay in school kids."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place. It's a McDonald's. Usually busy and full of people just kinda hanging out. It's loud here, but the food comes out quickly and is usually warm. Not sure if it's \"fresh\", but not bad. I normally only come and get breakfast stuff here. Not a big fan of lunch/dinner food here. It's a hit or miss with the staff. Sometimes they're super friendly and sometimes they aren't..just like any place I suppose."}
{"text":"do not go to this location at night thesee people will screw up your  order then call you \"gay\" faggott because they don't wanna replace it this chick named felicia shouldnt even work there let alone be. shift mgr. omg this is the most ghetto unprofessional establishment in the history of mankind.  now i see why they are where they are    must suck to hate what you do and not be able to change it because all u have is a hope to someday obtain a g.e.d.   Threatening to fight customers I mean really what the fuck.   Sincerely for the McDonald's gangster!!!!! Lmao. Wow if you even knew how pathetic you are having to spend your  nights at a burger joint is be pissed at the world to.  Good for nothing being..  Such a sad sad life to be stuck in. Wish you the best at Hamburger University"}
{"text":"Just left this place. This is my forth time coming here around 9pm-12am since I live around here. There is an African American lady who I think is the manager at this time, and she is rude. I got to the drive thru most times and she always claim that almost every beverage machine is broken, besides the fountain drinks. EVERYTIME!!! Never fails. She only says that because she is too lazy to turn on the other machines, also when I got my burgers, they weren't wrapped. They were poorly thrown in the bag with the wrappers on top of them. WTF?!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of fast food. But sometimes a girls gotta eat late! I came here after my LONG flight from Honolulu and I was pretty darn hungry. \n\nThey were out of Southwest salads, but the bacon chicken wasn't bad. The salad was still fresh and the chicken was warm. I would go back if I ever had a late night McCraving!"}
{"text":"The service here was terrible. They got my breakfast order wrong three times, each time with the same exact mistake. The morning  cashier there, dalia, didn't even attempt to move a muscle to get me the right order. Food is just like any other mcdonalds, service was the worst. There's 50 others you can go to within a mile anyway"}
{"text":"Didn't expect to be writing a review for McDonalds but I didn't expect I would be craving a yogurt parfait after work past midnight either so here we are~\n\nI just had to make a shout-out to the manager in charge with the best service recovery. No, she did not give me my thing for free but the way she handled the situation, she must be commended. \n\nWent through the drive thru and ordered a parfait for a dollar. Drove to the next window and the cashier charges us $12 even after telling her to wait and to double check. Awkward. But the manager immediately came over to the window and refunded us. Continuously apologizing for the inconvenience and explaining to us that the cashier will listen better when trying to communicate. \n\nSmall action but meaningful gesture!"}
{"text":"This McDonald's is located just a couple of blocks from the hotel I stayed at in Las Vegas - an Embassy Suites Hilton property - therefore it is within walking distance (There does not appear to be many businesses within walking distance of this hotel).\n\nHad a late lunch here around 2:00 pm.  Ordered the #3 value meal: Quarter Pounder w/ cheese, medium fries and lemonade.\n\nMeal came up promptly, was hot, not greasy, fries were crisp - all was good!\n\nInteresting note: in order to use the restrooms - you have to let them know at the counter - and then they buzz you in - no physical key. Makes me wonder about the status of the surrounding neighborhood!\n\nThere is also a large red DVD rental machine in the dining area of this Mickey D's."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but we had a bad experience here. First of all they were out of mc chickens which I don't mind but the thing that made me mad was the lady at the window was so rude. She handed us our food then shut the window we then waited for her to open it up to ask for sauce she gave us attitude and only handed us one. We then said thank you and she didn't say anything just shut the window. We then drove off and once we got to the freeway we realized all of our food wasn't there we had items missing that we ordered, plus one of our sandwiches we asked to get it plain and it was full of lettuce . So we turned  around drove back went inside, there was a long line so we went to the front and the lady then told us we had to wait in line. Why should we wait in line when they messed up our order and we had already waited once in line. Just overall im not happy with them and I won't be back."}
{"text":"This McDonald's has the nicest decor I've seen in the US. Each table has a flower vase with flowers and the tables have an old school Diner feel to them.  The staff is friendly by McDonald's standards ;)."}
{"text":"Even though I had a bummer of a time lastnight in the drive thru, I would like to say that the traditional egg mcmuffin is still exactly as it always is...delicious! That's what I like about McDonalds, you can expect the same thing each time you visit. And I visit once or twice a year. Just wish this location had a more efficient drive thru.\nOther than that, the food was good."}
{"text":"This review is for the drive-thru at this McDonald's location:\n\nHave never written a review for fast food, but just wanted to say that this particular McDonald's had a FAST drive-thru! I was literally there and gone within 5 minutes or less. I am just so surprised because other drive-thru's take much longer at other locations. One more plus, the drive-thru is open 24/7.\n\nWarning though, this area is ridden with homeless people. Locals know this, tourists may not. It's located just east of Sands & Paradise, where the road changes names to Twain...it's central Vegas, AKA the Naked City. Which is why I drive through! Wouldn't recommend getting out of your car in this area.\n\nSilly little review, but I wanted to share this :)"}
{"text":"Worst McD's ever ! Will never return, person taking order in drive thru sounded high and slow as $hit"}
{"text":"Lol what an embarrassing establishment .. Came here when my sister visited Vegas for a milkshake and they have turned off the machines before 12. The employees were rude and obnoxious."}
{"text":"Let me begin to say how disappointed I am at this McDonalds drive thru employee and her Supervisor.  Lazy and unhappy could be a way to describe their attitude.  The Supervisor seemed overwhelmed doing her duties managing a McDonalds, nevertheless trying to communicate with customers. \nI ordered my meal and when I got to their window to pay, I showed the drive thru attendant the McDonalds app coupon I had to use for this meal.  Her actions seeing this APP was the most difficult thing she's seen, her dull-lazy ILL face expression it self was priceless.  She asked me what that was, I told her that it was their McDonalds APP that this McDonalds participates in promotions.  She said that they don't and that the code isn't working. I told her that she needed to try again or get her Supervisor to help on this matter. When the Supervisor saw that her employee was stalled at the drive thru she stepped into see what was happening. She didn't attempt to put the code in, ask me for it, she typed something else in the screen then told me that they don't honor that here. With her strung out face she told me to pay the full price and I'll have to wait for five minutes for my order.  I told her that their wasn't any effort in using this coupon number on her behalf, then she said that she knew that they didn't honor that here. So I had showed a receipt from the same McDonalds, showing them I used the APP on a different order two days ago here. Even after that their demeanor was even worst, showing them that receipt was their destruction; their face of being proved wrong was even worse, she punched more nonsense into that screen, mumbling something, she turns around and says that they couldn't honor that coupon. So I said thank you and I won't be paying for anything at this McDonalds. \nWhen I was leaving there were the three cars in front of me parked by the door returning their orders or having them fix whatever they messed up. The diner was closed, so an employee was attending them at the door taking back their bags. I had the window lowered and could hear a customer telling him that their missing half their order and a Big Mac was missing a beef slice. WTF, really! Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. Some of the worst service I have ever encountered. Been here a few times, order always wrong, service slow and none of the employees or managers care. If it wasn't near the convention center and on one of the busiest streets in Vegas it would have closed long ago."}
{"text":"The WORST service I've encountered in a McDonalds so far in the continental USA. No, not because I dislike the food but because the employees here are IRRESPONSIBLE, FORGETFUL, and UNAPOLOGETIC. I overheard from one of my superiors that the staff at this particular McDonalds ALWAYS screws up orders EVERY time they come here. \n\nThey will charge you for the wrong item, leave out several items, give Iced Tea instead of Iced coffee. When I was there, I was the first one to order and I ordered the Skillet Burrito and some OJ. My OJ came out after 3 minutes but my food never came out. ALL OF MY co-workers ordered their food and their food came out and they were already seated and having their breakfast while I'm still standing at the counter waiting for my burrito for a good 10 minutes.\n\n I finally lost my patience and ask the girl who rang me up where my Skillet Burrito was. She simply says \"Oh, it's run out, \"we NO HA-VEH\". I tell her \"So are you going to just stand there and do NOTHING?!?!?!?!?\" That's when she asks me \"What do you want???\" You want burrito!?? We only HA-VEH Sausage and Egg Burrito it's ok? I say \"NO, it's NOT OK because Skillet burrito is MUCH more expensive than a Sausage and Egg Burrito!! Just give me two McGriddles...NO!!!!\" And so she did.\n\nPURE RETARDED OPERATIONS at this particular McDonalds. Will NEVER return to this McDonalds or even McDonalds in particular. Only reason we ate here was because we needed to grab a super quick breakfast before heading to the convention center."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had! We ordered 3 cheese burgers, 1 med., fry 3 large fries, and 2 spice chicken sandwiches. We received 2 cheese burgers, 3 large fries, and 2 spicy chicken sandwiches. Shorted us on our food! We try to order a ice cream but their machine was broken, we tried to order coffee but their coffee maker was broken and our last resort was to order a soda but they had no carbonation for soda. Went to take a bite of my fries and third was no salt on the fries! Burgers were ok though. Never again will I order from this McDonald's. By the way we waiting over an half an hour in the drive through."}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's I've ever been too! We ordered Mocha Frape, a vanilla latte and 6 cookies and we waited for 15 mins and 3 wrong drinks after. But they gave us an extra drink because of it.."}
{"text":"Please people if you are looking for a \"fast food\" to eat do not go to this place. 15 minute for a simple double cheese burger. Employees work slower then my grandma."}
{"text":"Seriously screw this location. The line never moves. All of the staff are high and disoriented. And the food is always cold. Shame on McDonald"}
{"text":"They say location is everything, this proves it since the staff certainly wouldn't last anywhere else.  English certain isn't the first language here."}
{"text":"I vote McDonald's new motto should be \"Consistently horrible\", I SO am not loving it. The only reason to eat their crap is the dollar menu. Where did it go? And most locations don't have dollar drinks anymore."}
{"text":"I guess McDonald's as a whole is just failing to be a pleasant dining experience. This location, at 7:30 pm has no Ice tea, and the place was filthy also. I always have better experiences at Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr.  I am not going to McDonald's again."}
{"text":"They're so slow. Worst one ever! They should do the 60 second challenge like other locations because they lack speed and service!!!"}
{"text":"Easy parking access but limited parking spaces\n\nThe cashier just couldn't get our order right. She had to ask several times about our drinks and I kept correcting her: two coffee, both with four cream, one with 1 equal and other with 2 regular sugar. She asked if we wanted two cream. I reminded her four cream each. Ordered one OJ but have us two, so returned one. We couldn't tell which coffee had regular sugar vs. Equal, so we had to taste test.\n\nI never knew getting drinks right was such a task...\n\nThe food was good as usual."}
{"text":"If you're in a hurry, do not stop at this location, long drive-thru wait... really long, waited 15mins for food.  Time of visit: 10:40pm"}
{"text":"Worst McDonalds EVER! I came here a few nights ago late night (around 3 am) through the drive-thru of course and ordered as usual. Breakfast to be exact and when I tell you that the wait had to have been one of the longest I've ever experienced, it was the LONGEST. I stayed in the line for a total of 22 minutes! YES! 22 Minutes!! I couldn't believe it and when I got to the window the rude lady taking the orders and payment said that it was too bad if I wanted my food fresh then I should appreciate the wait. EXCUSE ME? oh no.. but then I had to realize what part of town I was in and yes, reality set in that it's the normal type of behavior to expect on those parts of the woods... yeah.. never again!"}
{"text":"Very nice lady at the counter. Restaurant fails at quality of food. My chicken nuggets were stiff on the outside, like stale cardboard and my sweet tea tasted like something words can't describe with a strong aftertaste of something.\n\nHad a couple of gnats or flies flying around in dining area...with a dead gnat on the serving counter by the register...umm - ewww.\n\nUsually stop in here once every two or three months for a quick meal...now I'm reminded why I wait so long in between visits."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, food took forever to come out, cashier was rude, need I say anything else"}
{"text":"I have no clue if the crew has changed in the last month but the service I've received here for the past two weeks has been excellent. I usually get breakfast here and I have never waited long each morning. The people who take my order, hand me my food and drink are professional and I haven't seen any bad attitudes from them. I've even asked for additional cream, sugar and other items and have never been met with eye rolling or mean comments. This has been my experience in the two weeks of going here."}
{"text":"I used to go to this one a lot (when fast food was a regular staple in my diet, in my 20's, when my metabolism was faster, and when exercise was not such a priority)- this is one of the older ones in town. \n\nRecently, we went through the Drive-Thru window for some fruit smoothies. There were a couple cars in front of us. Clear mike, speedy checkout, nice girls, the correct order, and great-tasting smoothies. \n\nWe only go to McD's for a few things (parfait, cone, and sometimes the breakfast sandwich) and even then, it's pretty sporadic- maybe a few times a year, because of the lifestyle changes we made since maintaining our weight."}
{"text":"I have to strike this fast food venue from my normal few lunch spots for awhile.  The last two visits have been a disappointment.  My french fries were cold both times.  I ordered a Premium Chicken wrap with crispy chicken last week and received grilled chicken.  The receipt had it right so it was the line cooks who got it wrong.  Today I ordered Chicken McNuggets as a combo.  Again and as I said before, cold fries.  And I can guarantee the McNuggets weren't fresh.  I got my food before I even got my change.  It had all been sitting there well before I ordered.  Besides the food, service was terrible.  There was one lady taking orders and she was even making some of the food.  It made for some very slow service during a very busy lunch hour.  Rather than calling out an order or order number when ready, she looked at my boss and said \"this is yours.\"  How rude!  There was a gentelman waiting for his food since before I walked in and was still waiting after I got mine.  His wife took her sandwich back and said it was not fresh.  She got a dirty look from the same rude cashier.  I miss the days of the old manager whom I have not seen in a few months.  He had the staff on their game."}
{"text":"Employees here really take pride in their restaurant.  They made sure the dining area was clean and their napkins and ketchup station was stocked up and clean.  Well organized restaurant.  Great job!"}
{"text":"This place is dirty bunch of high school kids works here which they don't  care about service"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with my visit this time to this location. Suprisingly it was by someone who is a shift manager who was working the window. How can you take my order over the speaker and still have a conversation with another employee? It took her several tries to get my order right!! Then when I get to the window she doesn't even say hi or tell me my total just puts her hand out for payment. As I gave her my card I asked her to please give me jelly and extra syrup and butter. All she did was smile when I said thank you. Took them a good 15 minutes to get my stuff as she was a way from window by the inside counters talking to employees. When she finally gave me my order I reasked that I got the jelly and syrup and she goes to reach to get some and then says OH its in the bag. \nNow I ordered Big Breakfast with Hotcakes and Bacon, two sausage and egg mcmuffins, hashbrown and a coke. When I got home I got everything BUT the HASH Browns!!!! I was to get two of them one with the Big Breakfast and the extra one I ordered. UGGG it was on my receipt. the name on the receipt stated KS #15. So not right especially by someone in Management"}
{"text":"This McDonald's in Viva Las Vegas is particularly nice and clean.  The parking lot is pretty easy to navigate in and out of with the busy traffic on W Charleston and the restaurant's close proximity to the freeway.\n\nGreat place to grab your morning coffee and breakfast and take a lil break and relax.  The food has consistently been quality and fresh tasting, the service very good.\n\nNice plus?  Close proximity to the hospital. Bring your own coffee and nosh when you're headed over to visit a friend in the hospital.  Bring 'me a little breakfast danish or cookie as a treat!"}
{"text":"When you need a fast bite (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) so you can hit the road, this McDonald's is right off the 15 fwy on Charleston in the downtown area. It is clean, no bad people, and a fast drive thru. I gamble but not when it comes to fast and friendly McDonald's service. That is I like this one here."}
{"text":"Went here after work for a quick Mickey D fix. I had order a 6 piece chicken nuggets meal. Sorry to say but I think it will be my last time here. Don't get me wrong, the food tasted fine by my insides didn't think so."}
{"text":"The food was good, fast service and the manager was really nice to the kids ! The place is spacious and a good playground for the kids."}
{"text":"Enough is ENOUGH!!! This has to be the worst McDonald's.....IN THE WORLD!! This is the closest McDonald's to where we live and i am willing to drive farther to avoid this place. They move at a snails pace and cant get any simple orders correct. Watch out as they do not give any receipts to your order and when they mess up and you go back to complain or get your order correct....the manager will ask \"where is your receipt\"??? This place is the absolute worst customer service and incapable employees."}
{"text":"I was kinda upset during my last visit here. Normally, I pay using my debit card but on this occasion I had cash. So here comes the disappointment... As the cashier goes to hand me my change she drops some of it! (Note: I'm in the drive thru so it is not easily retrivable.) She then looks and shrugs here shoulders and kept it pushing! I looked like WTH?!?!?!? She didn't open the drawer and give me correct change nothing she dropped my change and kept it pushing! I've never experienced this before. They have always corrected the change when THEY drop it. I mean she dropped it before I even put my had out the cat window. I'm like come on now... I didn't drop it! Its not MY fault. Urgh! Anyways this experience was overall annoying and off putting!"}
{"text":"THEY were pretty eager to close I dont blame them. But overall the staff got my egg mcmuffin and managed to put only a little ketchup on it. Even though the task was out of the ordinary to put ketchup on an egg mcmuffin somehow they managed to figure it out."}
{"text":"Slow, incompetence, had to go in and get my food after they said they will bring it out.  15 minutes for fries no salt. Their excuse there is only 2 of us here. Had to remind them to give us everything we ordered.  Really!!!\nAfter I left the worst nuggets ever. Argh!!!!!"}
{"text":"I called this McDonald's at 04:55 pm today December 1, 2016, a guy answer the phone all dry McDonald's? Then I asked him his name he held the phone then he got back on the phone I ask for a Manager he put me on hold; I stayed on hold til 05:20 pm so when someone picked up the phone without saying anything. So I hope they heard me,I said \"I'M going on Yelp right now. Whoever it was didn't care they just held the phone. A manager never came to the phone I heard conversations one guy happy he was getting off a 6pm"}
{"text":"If they went any slower, I would have grown a man beard. Which is difficult seeing how I am a woman. I'm sitting in the drive through as I write this. I've been here for 10 minutes without moving and there are only two of us in line. Let me get out my shaving kit... while I wish I cared so little of deadlines and time constraints, I just want my coffee, dangit!"}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes for them to get 2 large fries ready. On top of that their workers have quite an attitude. Worst McDonalds ever."}
{"text":"Not a bad Mc Donald's as far as this chain goes. I've visited this location multiple times. The food is hot and service is speedy. The staff is courteous."}
{"text":"The food was luke warm and it took forever to get my food. They did not have enough people working for the morning rush for breakfast.  The workers were a little short on friendly.\nNeed to clean up the dinning room too. Lot of dirty tables with garbaage left on them.\nThe coffee was warm and it was very hot outside. The air conditioning was not cool and it was very uncomfortable eating."}
{"text":"I think that the preparation was a tad lacking. I used to work at a Mc D's when I was in high school. It was the perfect job for a kid.  Anyway, my filet was lopsided. It was half way off the bun and my cheese was melted three quarters off the fish. The tartar was every where and my fries were all mushy. I can't expect much from a Mc D's but goodness. There are some interesting folks who come in and out of here. THe awesome thing was that wall of the original Ronald Mc Donald and his lil side kicks. That was cool."}
{"text":"The Mickey D's breakfast vibe was strong in the work space and several of us were looking for some extra calories to fuel the early morning mental dash.  Given there was four of us with one getting a meal for another be opted to go inside.  Chaos an only describe the inside.  The wait, the ordering process, the retrieval of food seemed very disorganized and confusing.  When my order did pop up I did a quick cursory inspection of the two bags and was out the door.  We orbited the drive-thru (which is long) and noticed it was full of cars.  I was initially thankful we went indoors to make our orders.  It was only when we arrived back at the office did I notice that I was not F&*%ed at drive-thru but F%$#ed in the interior.  My order was wrong and.....I am ashamed to admit...I did not notice they did not give me my coffee (no exclamation mark needed).  And so began the internal debate with myself, just whose responsibility was it to make sure I got my coffee?  I then decided it was both mine and theirs,,,but mostly theirs.  When I am starving in the morning from here on out, I will just wait for lunch."}
{"text":"I don't think this McD has ever been remodeled. Other than a badass painting of the McKingdom, there was another thing hanging on the wall which was pretty much a quilt with like cactus (cacti) sewn in to it and there was another case that had a bunch of old pins and buttons and I don't think there was a pin that was made later than 1982 or something. One was for \"McDonalds Pizza\"\n\nThis thing (the painting) was pretty badass though, that's why I took the pic. It's like 10' x 6'. I think it was dated 1979. Which makes sense considering that Mayor McCheese is there and the McKingdom is there too\n\nI swear that place has been forgotten in time. Not only did it have the vintage artwork but the soda fountain was probably from the 80's as well because the ice machine and sodas were completely separate machines and there was a pay phone outside but it wasn't right outside the store, it was across the parking lot kind of in the bushes and had some weird phone company that I never heard of on it. Plus it had an electronic sliding door on the main entrance and the \"Play Place\" was outdoors and even had a sing that said \"Please Do Not Feed The Birds\". Such a weird place. It's cool because it reminds of the way McDonald's was when I was a kid but it's scary because it's not intentionally retro, it just never changed...\n\nIt's quite the experience. It's like the \"Classic\" McDonald's on Flamingo .....but a different kind of classic."}
{"text":"Breakfast for the family and kids.  8 of us.  Messed up the whole order.  Missing hot cakes, missing eggs, missing yogurt parfait, four napkins, four ketchups...\n\n1 star.\n\nBUT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM A MACDONALDs IN VEGAS!"}
{"text":"Being next to umc this place has a very getto vibe.  Need to get someone to enter the code to get into the unairconditioned bathroom.  other then that just a regular mcd."}
{"text":"Terrible McDonald's. Their food is always undercooked and cold. My co worker and I have gone there more than once, the burger was cold, so were the fries. We gave them the benefit of the doubt, and went again and ordered nuggets and voila. Cold again! Don't come here unless you want your food cold and tasteless."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Slow, takes forever to get your food, and get through the drive thru on a 97 F  day. Staff is not engaging, or proper responding to questions or telling you how much it costs.\n\nAlso, this is the ONLY mcdonalds were they have closed 10 mins before they are supposed to. They stopped answering the drive thru, their window, and people were denied service. Where does this happen? I could have received my food if people had answered  and taken my order but instead we waited and so did another car until it really was too late. They avoid you so they can close up ten mins earlier.\n\nWon't be coming again, the one on rainbow ROCKS compared to this; they are always friendly,quick, and great there."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is 100% than the one on Grand by Sun City West. Employees are nicer, and when you order they listen, and are nice to you. My order was correct, and it was served in a timely matter. The next time I want to go to McDonald's I will drive the extra miles for the great service. I will returned to this one."}
{"text":"McDonalds in Sun CIty, Bell Rd and Boswell. The Hi-C Orange Drink has out of order sign, for days. Managers say they don't know, indifferent, bored when we ask. No idea.\nNo outside handle on the back door for months. This is sooo inconvenient.,.\nTold manager. No interest."}
{"text":"I went to this McDonald's on my way to work and literally was in the drive thru line for twenty minutes! I received food, but it was not my order! The drink was diet! My hash browns were over cooked and my egg mc muffin was lukewarm! I ended up throwing out my whole breakfast! I don't usually take the time to fill out surveys but I did, I felt so annoyed to be five minutes late for work and wasted my money and time that I needed to report this to McDonald's. I received a phone call from the General Manager today and she apologized for the horrible experience and offered for me to come back in to have another meal. She understood that the way the drive thru line is set up that you are trapped and can't even leave if you want to, so disappointed with the situation. Anyway, I couldn't help but see before I left my review that the very first person on Yelp from 2013, literally three years ago complaining about the same thing, and of course there are others who have that same exact experience! Imagine all the thousands who don't bother to waste time but clearly this McDonald's has had this problem for years! McDonald's!! C'mon it is fast food!? No one should wait twenty minutes in a drive thru and get the order right! Honestly, I could have gone to JBs or Village Inn and sat down and ate breakfast within that same time; I know that because I have done it. This McDonald's needs serious help in customer service!"}
{"text":"If this is the one near chase bank and across from Starbucks they always have a line and 80% of the time I either don't get what I ordered or drive off with someone else's meal. What's strange is my change due is always correct. \nI've complained to them but they just blow it off. They tell me they are one of the busiest locations....."}
{"text":"Decent customer service when they are working and not Bs'ing .......\"HORRIBLE FOOD SERVICE\".....no reason I am the only person at the register, 2cars in drive-thur and have to wait 16mins  ....then to watch them make my order wrong and try to convince me its not...... on a quick break and didnt have time to argue........ I eat here because its across the street from my job, but I really hate this location."}
{"text":"They are making this the worst Vegas experience \ntowing  \n$300 dollars for 15 minutes \nWhy instead they don't have someone giving information \nThey're making money attacking travelers"}
{"text":"Breakfast with a view!\n\nThere really is only one reason for you to go to a McD's on the strip... you're hungry and/or drunk.\n\nAs far as McD's go, this is a pretty nice one! Clean and modern with a lot of staff working all the time.\n\nThis place has one major perk though, you get to watch people misbehaving while they're drunk or on drugs! Seriously, I had a blast!! It started with me arriving while the cops were handcuffing a junkie on the parking lot. The guy was talking to himself and shouting insanely funny random words at people (purple melons anyone?) And that wasn't all! There was a sweet old lady inside (who was definitely schizophrenic) having a lovely conversation with her other selves. And the guy cleaning the mensroom was asleep inside a cubicle with the door open! \nLoved it!"}
{"text":"I'll never go to ANY McDonald's again. This was the final straw - worst smelling restroom of any establishment ever. Completely disgusting, management acts like they were never aware of the problem! Also, shitty they have a spy at the window looking for cars to tow, nice scam Ronald!!"}
{"text":"Nicest Mcdonalds that i've EVER been to.. it's literally like an oasis in the middle of the nasty ass desert. I will NEVER give another 5 star to another Mcdonalds\n\nPros: Everything surrounding this McDonalds for a little ways is ghetto. Construction.. homelessness, just ghetto and ghetto people all over the place. Including Circus Circus.. the most ghetto big hotel/casino there is lol... but then out of nowhere.. right to the left of Circus Circus is this Mcdonalds.. Nice trimmed grass, foliage and flowers that you know is meticulously cared for. The building looks modern and newly built.. day and night comparison to the the building next to it (Circus Circus). Once you walk inside.. it's like a whole another world. Everything is clean.. like not as in clean for a Mcdonalds of clean for a fast food joint, but holy sh*t do they clean the floors, tables, and restroom every 30 mins to an hour or something? Food is Mcdonalds food. It tastes like it should and it's priced like it should be priced. Fries were nice and the smoothie was more to my liking. Mcnuggets were nice and crispy too. Food came out quick and while I was waiting.. there was someone cleaning the tables and mopping the floors even though they probably didn't need to. It's big and has a nice sun room kind of feeling to it along with lots of TVs and free fast wifi.\n\nCons: It's a Mcdonalds. It's surrounded by the ghetto.\n\nBottom line: Just drop by and witness the messiah of Mcdonalds."}
{"text":"Approximately, only one register open with 20 drunk people in line. The \"pick up here\" takes about 15 mins to get your food. The slowest McDonalds I been to. The dinning area isn't as clean. One thing, the restaurant is very trendy and has free wifi. It's right next order to circus circus.. But, your stuck with a bunch of drunk people being very loud and annoying. Be prepare for it! \n\nRestroom was very dirty!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes, you HAVE to have your McDonald's.  Even when you're in the middle of a culinary Mecca.\n\nApparently I'm a sucker for grand openings and press releases blown way out of proportion, because after reading about this new McD's location I made a point to come here during my vacation.\n\nProbably the nicest McDonald's I've been to, considering there was an employee constantly cleaning and offering to clear customers' trays.  Educational excerpts from the Discovery, Science, and Travel Channels on various flat screen TVs were a nice touch.\n\nWe sat in the middle of the restaurant, on bar stools (surprise, surprise...see my Blueberry Hill review) attached to a huge counter...with fresh flowers!  We were surrounded by the typical plastic booths but I did notice that seating areas near the restrooms offered both club chairs (not sure if they were leather or pleather) and a more private booth section.\n\nNot much to say about the food since a McNugget here is a McNugget anywhere.  But at least I got my quarterly McD's craving out of the way..."}
{"text":"At first, I didn't understand the poor stars for this place... I mean, what do people expect from a fast food joint, especially one in Vegas? I'm giving it a 5 for location and service, because it's one of the biggest and fanciest fast food joints I've ever been. Great interior design, friendly service and super empty, which I love. It's a chain so the menu is set. \n\nFor service, I have to give it a 1 to the manager of the place (and the manager only!!!). Everyone was busy and the manager happens to leaning on the counter so I kindly asked her for a refill for my coffee and she pointed at one of her workers and said, \"give it to him\" with a real snotty attitude. I apologized and gave my cup to the younger guy and he rolled his eyes at the manager and gave me the refill. What the heck?!? I've been to other McDonalds and I always thought that the managers are friendly and helpful. \n\nService is all about management and despite what the \"controversial\" issue is between the workers, please always keep it strictly professional, and especially in public. I initially gave it a 5 because service was great but now... I'm giving it a flat 1 in hopes that the female manager reads this and realizes that it's NEVER nice to be rude to people in general, despite their previous or current behavior. Your poor behavior reflects the place and now, I see why this place received such a low score. Boo to you manager!"}
{"text":"Do Not Eat at this McDonalds unless its the morning shift. No amount of words can clue you in to how bad it is. Who is the lady at night that yells at customers or hits them with the broom she is sweeping the floor with. If you complain to the night manager as I did he says she has problems and there is nothing they can do. I am aware at night they have homeless around the place but this crazy lady can not talk to every guest like they are homeless trash. That is what she does."}
{"text":"If you stay at the Riviera Hotel across the street, you are probably going to stop into this McDonald's for it's Wifi.\n\nThis McDonald's will have long lines late at night for hungry club goers. Sometimes the crazy drunk guests make for some great entertainment as you wait for your order. There will be a sparse amount of homeless, but they don't seem to bother anyone."}
{"text":"I ran here from my hotel in 48¬∞F just for them to give me no BBQ sauce even though they asked my what sauce I wanted and then gave me a grilled ranch snack wrap when I asked for crispy and most importantly they didn't even have sweet tea !!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic yummmm true fast food hot a fresh first McDonald's I've been to that doesn't have a dollar menu it has stunk in this McDonald's twice its stinks they need air freshener how can anyone eat here and it smell like rotten eggs"}
{"text":"Probably the nicest McDonald's there is! Very clean, updated, and open 24 hrs. One of the employees (manager maybe?) even shut up a group of noisy little high schoolers REAL QUICK lol, which was nice as it was obvious that they were disturbing the rest of us trying to enjoy our late night munchies in peace. Kudos to him!!"}
{"text":"We went to McDonalds on our way to Circus Circus. I remember eating at a horrible buffet at Circus Circus and didn't want to go there for breakfast.\n\nI would avoid this place on the weekends. It was too chaotic we went on a Saturday morning around 11am. \n\nWe went a second time on a weekday and the lines were more manageable. \n\nThe workers call your numbers when your order is ready. However, there needs to be a better system. Our number wasn't called and our order was sitting on the counter for 10 minutes.\n\nOh well. Cheap breakfast grub."}
{"text":"Be Ware of towing fraud at this Premises. My car was towed away from here even though I was a customer at this place and just had my Lunch there. After our Lunch we went to adjacent Subway to take some subs and by the time we came back, our car was towed and we were handed over a business card by a guy standing in the parking lot.When we called up the number, we were told to pay $324 to get the car back. This is a scam and as I was walking out of this premises, I saw another poor guy's car was being towed away. I don't find a place anywhere, where a car is being towed away every 5 mins or so."}
{"text":"This is the biggest and nicest McDonald's I've ever been to. My family came from Florida to spend Christmas here and they staid in Circus Circus. We ate here almost everyday mostly in the afternoon. I have to say that the tables were always clean and i didn't see any left over food on them. The cashiers taking orders were all so nice and our orders were never messed up. I like my cheese burgers plain and sometimes that simple detail is missed in other places... not here :) i really like this location and the people who work here are nice. Big props to the cashiers mainly for having to deal with all the tourists in the area."}
{"text":"Very spacious, single-level design with high ceilings. The only McDonald's in Las Vegas that loudly plays house music while you eat. Transients and tourists cross paths at this location. Seems safe and clean. The staff are friendly and prompt. Would come back again if in the area."}
{"text":"I gotta give a shout out to this McDo!!! Staying at the Encore in Vegas... a bunch of girls lounging around in our PJs, lagging on getting ready to hit up the clubs, we started getting hungry, but were pressed on time. With a list of everyone's orders in hand, two of my girlfriends and I took a cab in our PJs to the nearest McDonald's and ordered $80 worth of food!!! I thought it was hilarious that we bought 90 pieces of chicken mcnuggets, lol! The food came out fast and the only thing missing that we realized only after already being back in our hotel was a Vitamin Water... at least no one was missing a meal. So for that, thanks McDo!"}
{"text":"BEWARE!!!!! This Mcdonalds tows vehicles like nobody's business. Major scam going on at this location!!!' My friends ALMOST got their car towed and THEY WERE EATING THERE!!!! They ran out as the ass hole tow guy was lifting it. Would not put it down even after we my friends said they were customers here. They haven't eve finished their lunch yet!!!! The ass tow guy wanted $200 CASH or he was towing it!!! Well, they paid but after getting home they contacted corporate and got their money back!!!  MCDONALDS...YOU NEED TO RETHINK WHO YOU HIRE AS YOUR TOW COMPANY. Franchise owner of this Mcdonalds.... you suck for letting this happen and pretending you don't know what's going on. You hired this tow company!!!!!! THEY ARE SCAMMING INNOCENT CUSTOMERS BIG TIME. \n****Anyone having their vehicle towed wrongly, needs to contact mcdonalds corporate and get their money back! ****"}
{"text":"On second floor. Same good food as always & good prices. Rare on the strip. Take elevator or escalator to walk up. Busy but not much of a line-it moved quickly."}
{"text":"Carny Strip pricing on some items, but not on others, and at least they have one of the new comfier modern interiors with lots of seating ... surprisingly with lots of power outlets around too. Nicer than you'd expect from all the hobos always huddled out front.\n\nDollar menu items are about 50 cents more than usual ... combos about a buck more ... the real gouging is on drinks, though. Don't expect the \"$1 any size\" deal here! $1.79 for a small soda and like $3 for a large. \n\nStrangely, desserts and ice cream are the normal prices. 2 pies for $1, sundae for $1.30, shakes for 2-something, etc. Surprised they gouge on soda but not on these in the 100 degree weather."}
{"text":"I'm usually very skeptical of fast food joints altogether, ESPECIALLY McDonald's. \n\nBut I was surprised at the huge size and grand design of the building. Lines were orderly, service was quick, and our food was unusually fresh and neat. \nAnd as always, cheap as can be.\n\nBy far the best McDonald's I've been to. \nThere are even TV screens up above that show aquarium video to keep us entertained."}
{"text":"The only reason I came back is because they gave me free food after the fiasco from last night."}
{"text":"Like all other McDonald's, the service quality is going down the tubes.  My son was getting a drink at the drink station when an older guy in his 60's was moping the floor and told me son to \"move it\" in a very mean and rude voice.\n\nI went to use the restroom and there was two toilets.  One had a sign on the door that read \"Out of service.\"  The other stall's door would not make a close connection.  I really had to go, but I did not care to have someone walk in on me when I am on the pot.  I tried slamming the door shut, but it would not make a connection.  I told management about it, but they seemed to busy to care of do anything about it."}
{"text":"Same here, got my car towed. When I got back to the lot and my jaw dropped thinking my car was stolen, a guy instantly appeared next to me and offered his business card and the information where I can go to pick it up. Of course, the impound yard is at the very end of the city, took about 40-45 minutes by cab. I shared the cab with an Asian tourist whose car was also towed. I had no cash on me, no ATM near the impound yard either, the kind Asian guy paid for my impound and for the taxi and came back with me to the city where I could get some cash and pay him back.\nI loathe mcdonalds and their rip-off scheme. The tow trucks are actually parking right next door waiting with engines running. The spotting guy is standing around all day and as soon as you are out of sight he calls the tow truck and your car is gone in 60 seconds..."}
{"text":"Fantastic & polite staff! Nice, clean, spacious McDonald's. It is apparently in the 'ghetto' part of the strip next to Circus Circus and there are quite a few homeless folks hanging around there but my friends and I have never had any issues (even late at night). \n\nI was impressed by how crispy and fresh their chicken mcnuggets were even at 3am! Even though my friends and I were a little incoherent during one of our visits, the gentleman at the cashier remained courteous at all times. He could have given us some choices to our dipping sauces but honestly, I didn't really care at that point. \n\nAll other food items we had ordered were great. We would have liked milk in our coffees but I guess it's a Canadian thing since they only had cream. My friend says cream from the carton is better than the individual creamers they give you, but be sure to mention that while ordering because they can't add it in for you afterwards??? (just a heads up in case you have particular cream preferences)\n\nThere is also a McDonald's in Circus Circus but I prefer this one because it's cleaner and brighter =)"}
{"text":"Beware! They rip off foreigners.\n\nI visited there last monday night and had the worst Vegas experience ever. \n\nThe story is simple. I parked my car in their lot and had some Subway sandwiches at the next door. And got back to the McDonald's getting some deserts. \n\nJust after I left the door. My wife and I got shocked. They towed my car. It happened just in 15 minutes. There's a sign saying, \"30 minutes parking for McDonald's customers\"  I didn't do anything wrong.\n\nAt the impound yard, I met other victims from Germany. They're making money attacking travelers from outside US."}
{"text":"A nice central McDonald's with ample fountain drink dispensers for the visitors. Be aware of your surroundings here, it attracts a few transient people. The WiFi provided by AT&T sometimes works, just like their cellular reception, so no surprise there. I'm a frequent visitor here to grab drinks & work before visiting hotels. There are quite a few power plugs for laptops inside of the building."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this location after being at Circus Circus at approximately 10pm a Friday night.  It was busy, but not chaotic.\n\nYou place your order at one end of the counter and pick up at the end of the counter.\n\nI ordered a Quarter pounder with cheese combo and asked to make it large.  My wife simply ordered a small drink and a McFlurry.  We specifically told the girl we were eating in.  \n\nWhen our number was called, our food was in a to go bag.  I was also only given one small cup.  When I asked where my large drink cup was, I was informed that the combo which I paid extra for did not include a drink????\n\nThe lady was wearing a white shirt and spoke very poor English.  When I showed her my receipt where it said I had paid for a large Combo, she told me I was mistaken.  I then proceeded to go back to the cashier who had rung up my order and ask her what had happened.  She informed me that I should have got a Large cup as well as small cup but the lady in the white was her Manager.  I then asked to speak to another manager.  The cashier then waited until the female manager went in the back and a male manager came up, apologized, and gave me my Large cup.  ?????  He agreed that I was correct and that the cashier had rung up our order correctly but could not give me a reason as to why the female manager would not give me a Large cup."}
{"text":"I didn't order anything, but a free apple pie, that apparently was free because thy didn't tell me about it. This McDonald's looked nothing like the ones where I live; LA. But of course this is Vegas, everything looks better. I instantly fell in love with the cashier. He was a tall light skinned guy with a ear piercing He kept starring at me. I think he liked me too. I wasn't able to go back and ask him for his number. Plus I'm shy, I would never be able to. Anyways if anyone can find out his number that'll be great."}
{"text":"Don't die while using the sidewalk in this part of Vegas, It's a lawsuit waiting to happen at this location. LOL! never thought id write a review about McDonald's...."}
{"text":"Beware of this Mcdonalds. You are constantly under surveillance in the parking lot. I parked my car, had breakfast, and then had to go drop something off to a friend. Within 30 min when I got back, they had my car towed. WTF? It's like they are preying on people's cars. It makes you never want to go to this McDonald's again."}
{"text":"Ok ok ok, I know it's only a McDonald's, BUT this one is completely different in decor. It's big, clean, bright and pretty. With tons of flat screens all over the place. \n\nAnother big plus to this McDonald's is that they've got free Wi-Fi (while most hotels charge ridiculous fees), so if and when you have your laptop you can deal with business while munching on some fries.\n\nEven though it's smack dab on the strip, there's plenty of parking too!"}
{"text":"It sucked so bad the service is rude and the staff acts shy and shut off from customers our food tasted uncooked nuggets taste like rubber cheese burger was nasty I spent $18.00 dollars for undercooked  food never (NEVER) AGIAN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This particular McDonalds just sucks. I've only ever gone through the drive-thru because this one is closest to home, and in the maybe half dozen times I've done so, there's always been something wrong with my order, missing, or just cold. Last week I decided to go again before I had to go into work- at this point there was a line of 4 ahead of me. I saw this as a good thing because I figured I'd get some hot fries- wrong! I waited almost 20 mins in line got cold fries, old chicken nuggets and rushed service. This is the last time I hit this Mickey D's up again."}
{"text":"Not bad. clean, not busy. Food was as good as McDonald's gets. The only bad thing is that the employees were yelling and fighting in the back. Kinda funny but really unprofessional considering the age of them and that the manager was standing there laughing at them."}
{"text":"We drove to this McDonald location and we were shocked to find it closed. A sign was posted redirecting customer to another location."}
{"text":"They usually have a long wait time in drive through when it's busy. Other than that, the service is good"}
{"text":"It's been 8 minutes and counting and they STILL haven't taken my order. Joy I'm gonna be late for wk this AM *thanks* McDonalds on 51 & Elliot!\n\n-------------------------\nUPDATE\n\nIt took another 8 minutes to get my food that day for a total of 16 minutes to get out of there and YES I was late.  I do have to say that I did go back once since then and this time my order was quicker but they didn't have any customers so I'm not sure that's improvement or not."}
{"text":"I used to go to this location for breakfast, until the day they gave me a raw egg!  \nThe sad thing is that this is the second time this has happened at this location.  I even made sure to tell them to cook the egg all the way through, so you can imagine my shock and utter disgust when I bit into the breakfast sandwich and the yolk began running down my hand! \nI said I will NEVER go back to that McDonalds because obviously there is an issue with making sure food is thoroughly cooked.\nI did call the manager to inform him of the issue, and he was nice, but nice doesn't change the fact that the staff can't seem to prepare an egg properly.  I don't want to get sick because of someone else's incompetence."}
{"text":"No wait inside but receiving our order seemed to take longer than necessary.  I asked about the Elliot & McClintock location and didn't get any info about that store bit did learn this location is moving East to Elliot & Priest around August/Spetember."}
{"text":"McDonald's food is McDonald's food. There is nothing special about it. My food was on time and, well, food. The high point of my visit was the rude mouth breather that seemed pissed off that I didn't know what I wanted right away.  I know it's McDonald's and the menu almost never changes, but it's also 8am and I haven't had my coffee yet, so smile and wait a second for my order."}
{"text":"Something fishy is going on. Went here twice in one month, both times at 3:30 am (going to work) weekdays. The first time they told me none of my cards worked, but I just filled my car with gas and got a cup of coffee. Was told my American Express Gold card no limit was declined. They wanted me to pay cash only, so I left empty handed. Second time 2/15/2016 driving by I saw two cars in the drive thru so I pulled up to the drive thru.The girl tells me over the speaker \" I was told to tell you we are not serving food for the next 30 minutes\" again left empty handed.\nSo from now on I go to Shop and Save and buy microwaveable breakfast sandwiches when I feel like.  As long as the owner is making money who cares right."}
{"text":"This McDonalds sucks.  They are the slowest McDonald's I have ever been to.  I've gone here a few times and it's always super slow."}
{"text":"I like this McDonald's and go through the drive thru at lunchtime. Sometimes there is a long line but the order takers do a good job. Plus all the ladies are really nice and say hi. The food is the same as all other McDonald's that I've been too."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this McD's.  As mentioned before, you're taking a chance if you dare request a special order at any McD's anymore...but this one is especially bad with communication.  What ever happened to those \"Double-Checked\" stickers?  Even something as simple as \"ketchup only\" gets screwed up about 33% of the time.  Just happens way too often.  The kicker was a few weeks ago as we were just starting our vacation drive, and the kids wanted to drive-thru for breakfast.  One kid got a Big Breakfast...no pancakes.  Wife got an oatmeal...no spoon.  I got an iced coffee...all the vanilla was gunked up at the bottom.  Oh, and we were missing a hash brown.  Seriously?  Four mistakes in one order?  Believe it.  I still have the receipt and was contemplating another visit to the McD's website.  In fact, I hate to admit this, but I live within a few miles and I've contacted the corporate offices twice in the last year.  I've finally accepted that things are never going to change, but you can't explain that to the kids.  There used to be a Burger King across the street that was surprisingly worse.  Unfortunately, this McD's may have hired over that staff.  \n\nAvoid.\n\n(Unless you have time to rifle through your bag for accuracy)"}
{"text":"I never come here because as we all know this place is awful. I came here at 1120 and I have been waiting for them to sereneme for 15 minutes. There are only 3 people in the drive through. Please stop giving Mcdonalds business!!!"}
{"text":"Worked here as a kid so it brings back good memories. Close to the highway. Std McDees"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. After waiting in line for 15 minutes at 10 pm, we finally left. What an awful location. Don't come here."}
{"text":"I cant believe it could be this bad\nSimply the worst mcdonalds I have every been to\nManager is a serious joke\nHey mananger I know u work at mcdonalds but how bout taking some pride in your work"}
{"text":"Simply terrible anymore. The manager did not seem too concerned about the disgusting hair in our cheeseburger. And these people want $15 an hour. What a joke. And the manager, what a joke."}
{"text":"Why bother?  So many \"real food \" options at the same price.  Come on people get a life"}
{"text":"It's a McDees however compared to others in the area is super fast, friendly and very clean. No issues either with the drive thru."}
{"text":"Ordered a Blt and got a double quarter pounder lol who even orders that ? I didn't even know you could. Cashier needs to open her ears."}
{"text":"Beau restaurant neuf. Toujours un bon Cafe et terrasse sur le c√¥t√©. Service A l'auto 2 voies."}
{"text":"A ton of homeless people. They always get my order mixed up and they seem to rush you when ordering. I'll order four different meals and after each meal they say, \"is that all ma'am?\" And I say no and order something else and they continue to repeat \"would that be all ma'am\" its annoying."}
{"text":"Never thought I would write a review for a Mcdonalds, BUT one of the workers there is awesome! His name is Giang and he's super sweet. I see him every morning when I stop for my coffee. Most of the workers there are always so mad, he hands me my coffee with a smile and literally makes my morning a better one each time. This McDonald's should hire more people like him! I hope I'm spelling his name right I only catch a quick glimpse of his name tag since I take the drive thru. THANKS GIANG FOR BEING AWESOME!!!!"}

{"text":"1 AM Monday 25th of May\nNo one was there to take my order at the drive thru\n\nSeveral cars ahead of me and Behind me drove away\n\nBig sign saying \" drive thru open during construction\" no one there to take orders\nLights are on ???\nVery inconvenient and a waste of people's time :/"}
{"text":"Nothing exceptional about this location. \n\nSo while I spent 2014 in the UK, apparently my local McDonald's decided to expand the drive thru to two lanes that merge into one as it approaches the pick up window. That's how busy this place gets, they felt the need to expand the drive thru. \n\nAnyway, the staff here isn't as good as they used to be a few years ago. It has dropped off in terms of service, to be honest. A lot of that is due to the fact that young people move on from jobs so quickly, so I don't necessarily blame anyone at McDonald's for that. \n\nThey take orders pretty quickly, getting the line through fast and handing you your order. The issues that I have this with this location aren't necessarily with the food. The service, while speedy, isn't exactly friendly. Particularity the newer employees I've seen since coming back.\n\nBut the big gripe that I have with this place is the lack of security of their premises. When they expanded the parking lot and drive thru, they forgot to add security of some sort to mind the property. \n\nI've been harassed at the drive thru and in the parking lot by shifty drug people aggressively panhandling. The worst two occasions of this also occurred in the drive thru with other people in line while I was waiting behind them. \n\nThe first occasion involved a drunk Native American man who was standing in front of the drive thru speaker, knocking on some old woman's window while she's freaking out and locking her door. He tried this with me when I went through and I threatened him away. \n\nThe second time was a clearly disturbed man who was knocking on people's car windows in the drive thru, asking for money and sitting in the middle of the street. He didn't approach me, but did approach other cars and fell over twice in the street. \n\nThe McDonald's management team NEEDS to address this problem. When I brought it up to the guys working there, I got a shrug of the shoulder and a half-hearted \"sorry\". That won't cut it if they want to keep my business."}
{"text":"On my way home from visiting my father at the Hospital! Wife's at work,not in the mood to cook this late in the evening!!! I haven't had my yearly splurge of McRibs!!!! So I stopped off at this location, pretty big place! Walked in, because drive through was pretty busy. Only one person in front of me, it was time for me to order! I order the McRib Sandwich Combo, she asked me if I wanted it large! Well no, but thanks for asking! Then she offered me a second sandwich for only .99 cents!!! Wow, well yes! I love to have my yearly McRib sandwich, It's a great time! This half hour of eating this great icon of a sandwich was amazing! You get that stamped piece of pork, lathered in a authentic BBQ sauce and loaded up with pickles and onions, Yea baby!!!! It's only one time a year, and just once! After that I'm good for another year!! Going back to this location, it was quite nice. Very clean, bilingual, and great service!"}
{"text":"Thought I would stop in since they are under construction to let them redeem themselves. The corporation should have torn it down to ground, it is still the same gross food and poor customer service. The employees should study the store at Camelback and 7th Ave for what a store should be!"}
{"text":"I want to give this place a horrible review but as I was about write the review the guy working the first window saved the experience at least a little. I ordered the 20piece meal and the guy is like I can't do that. So he put everything in separate. And it's like a dollar more. No big deal the fact is that I was there last week and got the same thing. The guy who took my order kept asking what I was say, I speak good enough English that there is no mistaking what I said. Maybe I should get the guy q-tips. This is all on top of the long as wait. It's supposed to be fast food, I could have had faster service if I made the chicken nuggets myself. And I wouldn't even know where to begin to make chicken nuggets. Don't go to this restaurant if you don't have to not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"I came here to get a breakfast meal and no one greeted me at the window for about 5 minutes. Then they forgot my hash brown so they parked me and they were going to walk it out to me. After that they forgot about me so I had to go back inside and tell them. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Good service , but warning if you plan on going thru the drive thur you might be in line for 20 mins plus..."}
{"text":"Only come here for the dollar menu food.  Lots of people asking for money outside at night time, don't really like that."}
{"text":"I drove through and ordered two sausage mcmuffins with eggs to take home - two blocks away.  When I opened the bag, I, yet again, had someone else's order and had to throw it out.  Could these kids check the content of the bags against the receipt and, take lessons in good attitude.  The girl who threw the bag at me was just plain nasty!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke!!!!  Waited in drive thru for 10 minutes and repeated my order 3 times.  2 orders hotcakes and a large diet coke no ice.  You would have thought I had ordered a 3 course steak dinner.  I asked for extra butter with my order.  What I got was 2 pats of butter for 6 pancakes and no syrup with the pancakes.  Really???  The guy who shoved my food out the window looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there.\n\nC'mon McDonald's.  This is not rocket science!!!  Terrible service and I definitely will not return!!!"}
{"text":"Very terrible service. People have screwed up EVERY order i've made. Three times they've handed me a drink that opened and spilled all over my door in the drive thru after I've asked them to make sure it was secure. Once I waited for 25 minutes for 10 cheese burgers I was taking to a group of people who were helping me at an event.\n\nI've asked them specifically not to put things on my food and still they do. I told the girl I was deathly allergic to pickles (not true, but told her this so to make sure they were not on the burger) and yet my burger still had pickles.\n\nLuckily this McD's has made me not want fast food anymore. If I go to McD's I get a parfeit or oatmeal."}
{"text":"Had the worst burgers from Mickey D's from this location.  Filed a complaint and NEVER received a call back!!!  Horrible dry and old burgers (and they were premium $$$ burgers)...$17 for 2 meals!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke!!! I mean, really? No wonder these people have a 'job' at a fast food chain that puts emphasis on speed instead of quality. The workers are terrible. They never smile. The cashier will usually shout the total at you, then hand the receipt to you without saying anything. They will typically get your order wrong. It's a freakin' McDonald's!!! How to you screw up an order?? Apparently, a bunch of scum who can't get real jobs. They were so slow on my order today, that they had me pull to the parking lot so they could bring it to me. As an apology for me having to wait, the manager brings me a voucher for a free Happy Meal. Seriously, lady!? I'm 23. Now I know why there's always a 'Now Hiring' sign in the drive through. Bunch of clowns working here."}
{"text":"The food was great (hot, delicious, and appetizing)!  However, the Men's Room had no toilet paper.  When I told a worker about it, he disappeared to the back of the work area for more than two minutes while I waited.  Then, he gave me two rolls at the ordering counter in front of everyone who was on line ordering!  I had to walk back to the Men's Room with two rolls of toilet paper in my hands in front of half their dining customers.  I don't want to be a prude about this, but the manager should instruct his/her team on how to discretely resolve such an issue!"}
{"text":"Recently remodeled! Looks and feels modern with great new dining room lay out. Of course still one of the better McDonald's in the Surprise/Sun City area."}
{"text":"Understaffed, counter person doesn't even know what's on the salads, and the drink stations and tables are filthy. Can only imagine what the kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"If zero stars we're possible, oh would I ever. Not only did they screw up what I ordered, they couldn't even take responsibility."}
{"text":"As usual, lousy service. Came back here for a chicken sandwich and a small smoothie. Took literally 10 minutes for the smoothie. They seem to have run out of all the ingredients. Go figure. AZ in the summer. Plenty of hot coffee but no smoothies on demand. Makes me laugh. They screwed up my sandwich order. Not surprised, and took way longer than they should have. They looked understaffed AGAIN.  Others inside were getting agitated as well. Just don't get why these people can't seem to get it right."}
{"text":"I don't believe this place !!! If it was privately owned as a single restaurant it would have gone bust within 6 months. You have to be a certified idiot to get a job here. You try to give your order to an imbecile who has not got past the 3rd grade, and works the cash register also. After 3-4 tries she finally has your order right. After a 15-20 minute wait, your single cup of decaf comes up, right? Hell no. It all comes out of the same pot, the pot without the orange decaf band. There were two cups up at the same time, when i asked which one was the decaf and the coffee, the smart alec said \"take your pick, we only have regular rright now\" This is the worst experience at a McDonalds i have ever had and i am not alone, at least 4 customers were complaining about there order not being right. Never again!!!!!  Mcdonalds, get a grip and check this place out."}
{"text":"These guys are really hit & miss. A lot less efficient than other local McDonald's."}
{"text":"Completely remodeled.  HUGE improvement.  My kids call it \"old people McDonald's\".\n\nNo play area."}
{"text":"I should know better.  I know.\n\nMcDonald's generally wouldn't get more than a three for average service, but you know sometimes you get that craving and for me, I hadn't had it in a loooong time.  Long and tiring day at work sometimes needs to be offered a little unhealthy nostalgic fast food.\n\nIt's even worse when McDonald's employees don't even care to be there.  Seriously, how hard is it to put together a burger?\n\nMy BigMac came without a piece of meat and without cheese.  When I pointed out their error, the employee giggled and shrugged her shoulders and handed me another one moments later.\n\nDumb.\n\nThen they had a huge banner that said \"Happy People Day\" or some wierdness...signed by employees.  When I asked what it was about, they didn't even know.\n\nDuuumb.  You have a huge banner celebrating something that you're not even sure the reason for?"}
{"text":"This particular McDonald's if poorly managed. There is always a line and usually only one cashier. Today I ordered a McNuggets combo to eat in with honey, fairly simple. Order came in a bag without the honey. The ketchup machine was empty and blew ketchup over the straws and napkins. The bathroom floor was filthy, paper towels on the floor and the soap dispenser was broken. The corporate office needs to inspect this McDonalds and remove the current management."}
{"text":"This location sucks... They cant get simple orders correct. I only get coffee or ice cream from mcdonalds,  I don't like the food at all."}
{"text":"I had given up on McDonald's a while back -  in my opinion they sacrificed quantity for quality about the same time they went to a value menu.   Well, I have had a change of heart based on my last two experiences at this location.   Ordered Big Mac meal and egg mc muffin meal for dinner and was pleasantly surprised by the improvement to the products - everything seemed fresher and of better quality.   Also, I was impressed that they asked us to try the fries before we left the drive-thru and they were hot and fresh both times.   One minor overlook, forgot to ask for ketchup and would have appreciated the reminder question of \"do you need any ketchup?\"  Regardless, we will be back - missed having a good fast food restaurant close to home!!"}
{"text":"Going to see a relative at the nearby hospital and drove through to grab breakfast. I don't know what I was thinking. I was in a hurry but still  should've known better.\n\nSince my previous experiences were all bad, I kept today's order simple in hopes that the food would be edible: one sausage McMuffin with egg. I thought there was no way they could screw that up.\n\nWrong again. The english muffin was barely warm and the farthest thing from toasted or cooked as is possible. It was soft and dough-y. AND this McDonalds accomplished something I thought was impossible: the preformed egg patty was undercooked and runny. That's right -- runny. It was disgusting. \n\nIf I could give zero stars I would. This visit does it. I will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"Me no likely. Dirty bathrooms"}
{"text":"Very dirty place. Bathroom smells very bad due to no air fresheners. Sink and faucet needs replaced in men's room. Garbage on floor. Tile floor broken everywhere in such a way as to cause a safety hazard. Pop machine doesn't work on one side. Too many things too list. I could keep going."}
{"text":"I travel around northeast Ohio for my work but live near the Grafton Mcdonalds.  So, I can only say that this is the worst small town mcdonalds in my experience.  There are some worse when you get into the inner-city of Cleveland,  but this is the worst of the suburbs or small towns.   I've ordered coffee here at 615 am  ( they open at 6) and received cold coffee. ....how does that even happen?  I've been foolish enough to not check my order until I am on the highway only to find time after time that something is wrong or my coffee is cold. \n I've opted to take advantage of the promotion of buy a muffin for 1.49 and add a medium coffee for a dollar more and on two separate occasions been asked for 2.99. Then when I point out that it should only be 2.49 according to the promotion,  they have to get a manager to get my 50 cents and treat me like I'm being difficult.   Do most people not even notice?  I repeat,  this happened on two different occasions. \n\nTonight I went through and the cashier tried to give me the incorrect change and after I politely pointed out her mistake,  she never apologized....come to think of it she never used any words such as \"please \" or \"thank you \".  \n\nEven though it will suck to have to wait until I get to the next closest mcdonalds,  I have had it with my hometown one....I'm done!"}
{"text":"Even though this is a McDonald's and already held to an extremely low standard. This one is pretty terrible. The food always seems to be cold and the service sucks."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst McDonald's. I mean horrible. The wait is bad but the service is the worst I've seen. They don't even talk-no telling you your total no have a nice day-NOTHING."}
{"text":"looooong wait, always screws up my orders. poor customer service. was going to hire me but said I had to go somewhere else to do my orientation."}
{"text":"Eat at your own risk. The service is terrible, the staff seem to be generally clueless, the management is inclined to blame the staff for their own mistakes, and there's no sense of FAST in their fast food. When we came, half of the menu board was still on breakfast, and it was 4:30p. The only thing they have going for them is that the food is hot and tastes just like McDonald's should. \n\nThen again, the franchise is owned by Rice, and I've come to take terrible service is their MO."}
{"text":"This McDonald's has never been that great, but last night they reached an all time low. I ordered a big Mac and large fries. It was obvious that the fries were old and they refried them to heat them up. The bun of the big Mac was so stale, it was almost rock hard and most of the lettuce was turning brown. I have officially given up on going here. I'll drive the extra distance to go to the one in Oakland from now on."}
{"text":"If you want to wait 10 min in the drive thru for a screwed up order,   this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"This was a great McDonalds!  My sausage and cheese biscuit was seriously delicious and cost $1.42  Nice dining area, clean.  Very friendly manager.\n\nNot a big fast foodie but a cheap and filling breakfast on the go is sometimes a necessity.\n\nWinner!"}
{"text":"Worst mcdonalds i have ever been to. Last time i went chicken nuggets were under cooked. People were getting refunds wait time was so long. My daughter asked for gogurt w happy meal got apples had to wait 10 min to change to gogurt. Soda is watered down and gross. Rude staff doesnt know what they are doing. Will never go back even though its the closest one to me."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow but the food was just what you would expect from McDonalds!  Everyone was very friendly and the bathroom was clean...which made my 5 year old very happy!"}
{"text":"I've tried to give this McDonalds a chance but my patience has run out. The only reason why I came here as much as I did is because I like the $1 iced coffees. But it's not even worth it. This McDonalds is poo and so is most of the staff. \n\nWhenever I want to go through the drive-thru I can't because there is a line of cars wrapped half away around the building. And even when the line is shorter there's always a hold up of some sort. So most of the time I just park and go inside the restaurant. \n\nToday was a horrible day. I ordered an iced coffee (no cream or sugar) and a chocolate chip cookie. It only takes 30 seconds to fill a cup with coffee and 30 seconds to take a cookie out of the case. I waited 10 minutes!! Sorry but that's too long just to get a coffee and a cookie! It's not like I ordered a meal! During that time I saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! WTH?! I told the petite sleepy eyed cashier I wanted my money back! Her eyes opened wide in surprise, like I really woke her up or something. She said,\"Youre the one who ordered the iced coffee? I can get it for you!\" For real? She was the one who took my order! I told her I waited too long and I just want my money back. The manager offered to make my iced coffee, but  I refused because I had just had enough.\n\nThere are *few* employees there who work hard but everyone else is dragging their feet. There is no organization or teamwork, everyone is scrabbling. It looks like none of them want to be there. I used to work in fast food and I know it sucks, but come on!\n\nI'm sorry but I can't recommend this Mcdonalds. It's poo. I'm not coming back here anymore. Guess I'll be going to Starbucks- and their iced coffees taste better anyway!"}
{"text":"My expectations for McDonalds are t rarely high. But for one to still fail so spectacularly...that takes something special!\nThe cashier took my friends's order, then promptly ignored me. I had to force myself in front of a cashier who opened his register to wait on the person BEHIND me. I waited over five minutes for a gigantic order that included precisely one kid's meal. After watching two people who ordered after me be handed their food, I asked where mine was. The manager started yelling at the cashiers for \"serving off their orders\" when they didn't have their food. But neither cashier was anywhere near those controls, and the manager was the one serving food to customers and clearing the boards.\nThe manager was rude when giving me my order. She didn't make sure that I had everything ON MY RECEIPT, and never even had the decency to apologize that I felt I was getting poor service.\nI've eaten at various McDonalds restaurants for over 30 years. I've worked at more than one location. I expect bad days, bad moods, and the occasional mistake. But I have yet to have a decent experience at this store. It will remain a place I avoid unless someone in my party needs to avoid illness from low blood sugar. Perhaps I should go back to the racially biased service of Steak n Shake instead!"}
{"text":"This McDonald's is so bad it's amazing.  \n\nOrder:  Big mac, large fries, diet coke.\n\nThe soda machine was broken.   No sodas.\n\nThen I got to the window.  \"We rang you up for medium fries.\"   (Not what I asked for)  \"Well, if you want a large, you're gonna have to wait 4 minutes.  We just started a new batch.\"\n\nLeft with:  Big mac, medium fries, no coke.\n\nActually, now that I think about it, this was one of my better experiences there..."}
{"text":"Just went through the drive thru for a coffee and both the young woman cashier and the young man who made my drink were very friendly.  The man who made my drink even asked me if I wanted to try it before driving away to make sure it tasted the way I wanted it to. I can't speak to the food, as I've never eaten at this location, but I was very impressed with the staff!"}
{"text":"I should be able to give this McDonalds 0 stars.  If they had an award for worst McDonalds in and around Pittsburgh this would take the cake.  It blows my mind too.  Being in the Waterfront a manager could make this place shine but there's no polishing a turd.  P*ss poor service, a filthy dining room, filthy bathrooms, attitudes by the workers... If I had to give a real world example of what \"Misery loves company meant\", I would take you here and make you order food and sit down and eat.  If McDonalds depended on this one to do good they would of went out of business years ago.  I've gonna here a dozen times and 11 and a half times had the worst experience and the worst food I ever had from a McDonalds.  I'm sorry to be this harsh but you know what, no I'm not sorry.  This McDonalds ruined some of my best days and everyone needs to know to stay away.  I'd rather a second Chik Fil A at the Waterfront than this place.  \n\nStay away.  Far far far far away.  Don't even look at this place, cover the side of your face and just keep driving.  There's nothing to see here."}
{"text":"Best McDonald's I have been to! Everyone is so sweet and friendly! The drive through line was long but i got theough super fast. There were even napkins in the bag (which never even happens.) It wasnt always that good, i used to go to Wendy's to avoid the rude workers. But, it's great now!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of McDonald's in my time, this is the worst. Service was unbelievably slow, only frowns all around and not very clean. Just skip this one and you will be better off."}
{"text":"Dirty and super ghetto. Though you probably figured that out as you drove by."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. The staff are horrible, and they were extremely rude taking my order. I also ordered 3 hash browns and got only one in my bag. I will never come back to this location. There are quite a few other McDonald's in this area... I'd suggest going LITERALLY ANYWHERE else. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Service slow and not good at all ... \n\nOk - here is where consistency was extremely lacking in this well known chain. \n\nNothing was good - right from the phony looking decorations and fake plants to the managers attitude!\n\nBefore ordering - I asked if I could get a milkshake because it was early and was told yes - I proceeded to order my meal along with three other colleagues. The order was messed up as soon as the person taking the order realized she couldn't get me my milkshakes, which meant she had over charged our credit card. She had no idea what to do about that and had to get the manager who then acted like it was my fault and refunded the cash for one milkshake. However, there were two ordered and two charged so she had to then refund more cash - these milkshakes costs over three additional bucks over the normal price of the meal we ordered that included drinks - I know confusing. So after refunding the cash - I asked what I could get to drink and she said that would cost more - there was no drinks that would come with my meal???? So I just got a freaking glass of ice water!\n\nThe place was not clean - the service was P@## Poor and I would NEVER return to this location. The food was not hot, not packaged correctly and though they were not busy they certainly were flustered and unsure of themselves. There are other places to go - I encourage you to check them out and make this your last choice!"}
{"text":"Pulling up to the drive through and asking a question about a new sandwich prompted a rude and uneducated answer from the female cashier. After getting my question answered through a number of short responses I ordered the double bacon grilled chicken sandwich.. Which had no bacon on it. Ridiculous establishment. Management should pay closer attention to who they hire."}
{"text":"Really bad customer service. No smiles no positive attitudes. Kid in the grill area bluntly ignored the cashier when she asked for a side of Mac sauce after rolling his eyes so she had to have the other side do it. Then got an attitude becuz I asked for another side when I clearly asked for two in the beginning. I offered to pay for them and everything. And this bullshit where u have to buy a Big Mac to get the sauce is pissing me off. And it's only with the Akron locations. The Youngstown locations and Cleveland ones are not like that it's bullshit. If I want mac sauce for my fries and I pay the .30 for it there shouldn't be a problem. I am over these childish rude make things complicated for no reason owners. I won't be back to this one. Thanks."}
{"text":"This place is newly remodeled. It appears it has all new employees, true they've been with the restaurant probably since it re-opened in December. They need to get them retrained as in how to do their jobs. The pre-remodeled place while not the best looking had much better employees. This one... It is a clean and nice looking place, but the inside wait time is horrible. As it is in quite a few McDonalds, they feel it's more important to get as many orders and the money first and make the customer wait in a line to receive their food. Some take it to the extreme and actually place more emphasis on the drive through orders than they do the eat in. I've actually started going to the one on Steels Corners road which is a couple of miles further away, because if you eat in, you don't have the feeling of having to wait until the cars are served first. I doubt if I would return to this location very often."}
{"text":"Love the remodeled McDonald's now! The double drive thru is great and the parking lot is easy to get thru"}
{"text":"One of the best experiences I have ever had at a McDonalds.  Tom is the best service person in ANY restaurant restaurant period.  He is friendly, caring and fast.  He must be the owner, at least he acts that way."}
{"text":"Terrible service - left to wait for a long time in drive thru with no greeting. Later told no orders were being taken due to computers. It's a dual drive - I can hear you takings orders in the other speaker. When finally spoken to and denied service I advised them to tell me this earlier and he stated he was talking to other ppl. Yes, I can hear them. Apologize to me, offer a credit or even just let me know in a timely manner. Don't argue!"}
{"text":"Terrible I don't like how when u call up there to tell them something and they are rude and they cut u off so u can't speak and when your on the phone wanting to talk to a family member that works there that might not have a phone they say hold on and then u here them talking in the back ground like she can't call her phone and being mean about it. The workers are very rude and mean when I call up there or go up there."}

{"text":"Went there on a Sunday afternoon.  It was only moderately busy. But only one cashier (Jessica Carter) taking orders. She complained that kids in general in restaurant were screaming too loud and that she was too busy to accurately take our orders. Waited more than 20 minutes for our food. The order as placed on tray was incorrect.  A new low in fast food..."}
{"text":"My niece and nephew wanted McD's all day breakfast so we packed into the car and arrived by appx. 11:30am when we ordered the nice young man informs me that his manager is not allowing them to make certain things from the all day menu. Now what is frustrating about this is there is a FULL tray display marked all day breakfast with every item I wanted to order on it. WTF!?! Why even have the display directly on the counter. I understand they have the right to not participate but then DONT DISPLAY IT. The management here is always terrible.  As a store manager myself I am always appalled at how this location is run. I'm done with this place and I'll be sure to inform people to avoid this location and go to the new location on Cheyenne just west of Losee Rd. Considering it took us 30 minutes to get one happy meal and an order of cinna-melts. SMH wow!"}
{"text":"Starts as good still serving breakfast I'm happy ok. Then the McCafe machine is broke ok screw it I'll just by Starbucks. Next order taken employees shift change and forget to make my food. All I can say is are you kidding me"}
{"text":"Ordered a dbl filet and a chicken kids meal,  they only gave me a regular filet and didn't put the apple slices in the kids meal,  the fries were hard and cold, and the bathroom needs to be sterilized it looked like someone shaved in their since hair was all over the sink,  the floor was littered with tissue and towel not to mention the pee. I have noticed that all the McDonald in the north las vegas area are pretty much the same the first mistake was going to McDonalds the second was going to one in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Keep Driving.\n\nOn this day they were only accepting cash? \n\nI wanted to order a drink at the window where I paid and she she said I couldn't? \nMore like she wouldn't. \n\nKids shakes were dripping and messy so when I asked for extra napkins to clean up her mess the ding-dong gives me one napkin. Then I tell them napkins were not in the bags and when I asked for more they hand me ONE napkin.\n\nThis is when you give up and drive away!"}
{"text":"I am stuck in the drive through  for 10 minutes now. Waiting to order food. The employee still had not taken the girls order yet. Bull shit"}
{"text":"Every single time we came here they messed something up! But that's not the worst thing about this place.\n\nThe dumb ass kid employee's with their fucking salty ass attitudes!\n\nThe last time I came here, there was no line, maybe one car behind us. The young girl who took our order had the worst attitude. She completely messed up our order, she tried handing us an iced coffee and I don't know how she heard that, but we didn't order it and I guess that set her off even more so she rudely took it back without saying anything at all and so my bf got mad and said out loud \"Wtf is with this bitches attitude?!?\" We then told her that she forgot our straws and she came back and THREW it at my bf's hands, luckily he caught it in the air. So my bf cussed her out through the window and we drove off.\n\nNow, I recently made great change in my life so I miraculously didn't pull her ass through the window and beat the shit out of her. And for that, I am very proud.\n\nSo I really hope that girl, you know who you are, I hope she reads this:\n\nYou need to consider yourself very lucky. \n1. because I didn't break your face \n2. because you have a job. \n\nYou are a very unintelligent, ungrateful little dumb bitch and you deserve to get knocked the fuck out. It is not the world's fault that you work at McDonalds. How about stop being a cunt and get an education and go somewhere in life.\n\nAnd be careful who you throw straws at, next time you may not be so lucky."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Everytime we go there there's something wrong. Either they don't serve items at certain times like lunch items during breakfast, or the ice cream machine is never working! Just fed up with this place.... I'd rather drive further to go to a better mcdonalds."}
{"text":"this mcdonalds is so damn ghetto.. keep driving"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible. If they weren't a big chain restaurant , this place would be out of business for sure. I seriously can't think of any positive thing at this location. The wait time to receive your order is terrible. And it doesn't matter wether you go inside or in the drive thru. It's the same long wait no matter what. The employees are some of the rudest people I have EVER come across , especially at a \"restaurant\" ( that's using that term loosely ) . They have no regard or care for the customer. At first I just chalked it up to the employees mostly being teenagers , but then I spoke with the manager and it all made sense. It's no wonder they do and act however they want. After being told that I should go to a different location , simply because I returned my order since it wasn't what I asked for , I did just that. So it's terrible that I have to drive out of my way to get what I want and to be  treated respectfully , yet I would rather do that than visit this location ever again. Sadly Yelp makes you rate atleast 1 star which is well more than what this place deserves"}
{"text":"This was the third time in less than two weeks that I have tried to order from the drive thru and they said the system was done and they could not take any orders at that time.  Either they have very poor systems that continuously crash or someone is lazy and doesnt want to take orders. Either way I have wasted three trips to this McDonald's and will gladly go to another burger place across the street from now on."}
{"text":"McDonald's should never disappoint, but this one certainly will as they are slow as heck and 9 times out of 10, your fries WILL be cold!"}
{"text":"Came to this McDonald's a couple of times and tried to order a few drinks and their machine did not work for anything. No hot chocolate no hot mocha no anything. On top of that the lady in the drive thru said it hasn't worked for a couple of months. A multi million dollar company and they can't fix the machines?  Wth? Not coming to this mcd again.  And they are slow 10 mins to get a drink."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst McDonald's I've visited. The cashier was rude and they served me old, hard french fries. I ordered a ice coffee with a extra shot of vanilla,  they seemed to have messed that up as well. The ice coffee was bitter. They need to fire the late night staff and start over with people who actually value their job."}
{"text":"This place is the pits. So dirty and the laziest workers. Around the soda area plain filthy.  I think if I called the health dept they would shut it down. Zero stars is too much. Never will I go back"}
{"text":"The  management doesn't show they care about the  restaurant so the employees run a muck all around this establishment. The food is never up to par ."}
{"text":"Ewwww never eating from here again, ordered a bacon ranch salad they forgot to give me the ranch part, plus found a baby cockroach in the salad! Yuck I threw up once I saw something moving in my dam food! This is gross! How the hell do you give people food that has bugs in it! Please management check the food!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite McDonald's; the lines are never long and the service is great! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"We went through the drive-through this morning because were moving and can't cook our own breakfast. We never eat McDonald's. Ever. We were incredibly surprised to find wonderful customer service at the first window from Edward. The dude was super happy really upbeat made a personal connection with us in the car, and made us laugh.\n\nThe breakfast was on point. We got two Egg McMuffins, a hash brown and a vanilla ice coffee Mccaf√©. I don't know that you can mess up an Egg Mcmuffin, but ours were absolutely delicious. The coffee wasn't so bad either. And of course the hash brown is delightful. \n\nI saw that there was only one and a half stars here and that's a damn shame. I give you five stars from my car on this drive-thru experience."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this location a zero star they forgot the apple juices the apple slices I spilled my drink by accident and the manager saw it and she didn't even offered to replace  it and  every single one of the employees here seem to be annoyed by customers. The manager was no help at all I asked for wipes  twice they keep giving me napkins the tables were so dirty and nasty just enough for me not to come back to this location."}
{"text":"Every single time I come here, the ice cream machine is down. It doesn't matter what day of the week or what tine of day, it's broken. Buy a new one McDonald's, you can afford it!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Staff was too busy chatting with each other . I left with my 2 children after waiting 5 min to place an order. I will never return to this McDonald's ! I will take my business elsewhere and recommend you do the same."}

But this should be an excuse to give bad customer service. 7:22 am too bad I didn't get to see his name tag I just know that he is a short caucasian male  with bad customer service."}
{"text":"Seriously I do not know why I bother with this place other than it's the closest fast food to where I live.  So many fails it's unbelievable.  Burgers with no buns, wrong orders, soda without carbonation or taste.  I've even gone far enough to complain to corporate.  Even though they had someone call me about it they actual place didn't seem to improve.   Just skip it."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. This is the worst and when I say the worst I mean it they 1. Take FOREVER the slowest fast food in history. 2. Food is never fresh NEVER even if you ask nicely. For instance I just left the drive thru all I ordered was 4 cookies and a large fries I'm told everything will be fresh when I get to the window to pay...cookies were damn near cold, fries were old, stale, greasy and I had a large fry container but only enough fries to fill a small..so I said something the cashier gives me the look like I'm a complicated situation, I'm told to pull to the side for less than 3 mins and they will be right out...BS! I waited an additional almost 10 mins and they had the nerve to give me the same fries...you know the stale , old and greasy ones and just added a few hot fresh ones on top...I will never go back to this pathetic establishment they need to retrain staff, rehire, or just close it down all together."}
{"text":"I wanted to pick up some dinner, so I went to the McDonald's location on Craig Road and Camino Al Norte. I ordered a fillet a fish cooked fresh with extra tartar sauce, what I received was a burnt fillet a fish with barely any tartar sauce. I have been trying to contact that McDonald's location for hours, the phone number that is listed is (702)649-7578. I do understand I'm referring to a McDonald's, but if I am paying with my hard earned money I should get what I'm paying for, so I will continue calling that McDonald's location until I can speak to a manager."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast and ordered a sausage egg biscuit with an iced mocha. The cashier advised me that I couldn't get a mocha, when I asked about a frappucino she said no to that too, and then mentioned that they were out of orange juice. Essentially I had the choice of getting a sweet tea or a Coke product with my breakfast sandwich and hash brown. Now that I have experienced sweet tea with a sausage egg biscuit I can say with all certainty that these two items should not be served together.\n\nThis particular McDonald's does not exude any of McDonald's core philosophies such as variety or efficiency. It seems poorly stocked, poorly operated and under maintained. The bathrooms are filthy and I would suggest buying a cheap pair of socks for your child because their socks will be coated in dirt after 5 minutes of playing. The only thing that was good about my visit was my sausage egg biscuit sandwich. The hash brown tasted as though it had fried in old rancid oil. The sweet tea, while good by itself shouldn't be 1 of 2 options available during the morning since someone or something broke the McCafe machine and ran away with the orange juice.\n\nSeriously, don't go here. This is not the McDonald's you're looking for."}
{"text":"I understand weekends are very busy with all the angry customers I just wanted to recognize the young man the work the cashier he was very polite and kind ( although the some customers were rude ) he kept his composure and tried his best to keep up with the high volume."}
{"text":"Drive thru is absolutely horrible. Every single time I go to this location i sit in the drive thru for the very LEAST 30 minutes and most of the time it is just for 2 drinks not even food just drinks. Not to mention the staff is extremely rude!!  I will from now on make the drive to Lone Mountain and Decatur where they are quick and decently friendly."}
{"text":"If I can give it 0 stars I would. The bathroom had no soap. No ketchup or napkins. They claimed that my crispy chicken sandwich doesn't come with tomatoes then I showed them the big picture on their menu that obviously had tomato in it and their response was they don't have any tomatoes and I told them I didn't believe them. I'm not anal but I am pregnant and I expect to eat what is advertised! The worst thing was it was freezing cold in the play place and I politely asked them if they can turn the heat on and they told me they had no control over that. Unbelievable my child couldn't play."}
{"text":"It's alright they usually forgot what you order like if you order no salt on your fries they give you salt. I ordered a plain Big Mac just with meat cheese and bun they didn't give me the cheese plus they never ever have ketchup or napkins"}
{"text":"First things first: the limited service crew that was working this Sunday morning at 7am was nothing short of incredible. Specifically, a young African American man named Damon who was running both the front counter as well as the drive thru, is an extremely personable, genuinely friendly and professional young man that I would hire immediately. Despite the struggles of running the extremely busy fast food restaurant, Damon warmly smiled and greeted my son and I, engaged in small talk and maintained eye contact. He went out of his way to make the simple McDonald's experience a morning highlight, and I strongly commend and compliment Damon for his dedication and commitment to his job and satisfying the customers. \n\nThis McDonald's is definitely one of the weaker ones in the grand scheme of franchised McDonalds restaurants in the Las Vegas valley. At least part of this cannot be truly blamed on the restaurant itself as it is indeed located in a slightly less glamorous part of town in a busy corridor that tends to attract customers of the lower echelon (vagrants, homeless, street kids, etc). It is because of this that things like the bathrooms being locked and accessible only with the manager key  are expected and do not weight into my rating. \n\nThe play place as well as the restrooms are under remodel at the present time, so the floors are torn up quite a bit. This also does not rate into my rating. \n\nWhat does rate, however, are food preparation, equipment maintenance, and cleanliness. Unfortunately, this McDonalds tends to fall short in all three of these categories. \n\nFood Prep: We were there for breakfast and ordered a # 10 (two sausage breakfast burritos, hash brown, drink). Damon, our cashier, was extremely friendly as I explained above and automatically upgraded my drink to a large without an upcharge (I got a fountain drink). Once I was called that the order was ready, I noticed the burritos' tortillas were severely cracked and the ends were hard (clearly indicative of a non-freshly made item that had been sitting out for a while). Also, the hash brown was soft on the edges as well as the center, indicating under frying. \n\nEquipment Maintenance: This is the 3rd time I have visited this location in the past two months and every single time, Apple Pay is not functioning. The POS equipment is in need of repair and upgrades. Also the soda fountain was dispersing soda water on two spouts, indicating that the syrup was either needing to be replaced or the spout/hose was faulty. \n\nCleanliness: though I have seen an improvement here over the past month, this is simply not a clean restaurant. This largely stems from the clientele that must be constantly cleaned up after, but the tables, soda fountain area, restrooms, and counter do not appear to be cleaned as often as they should be. \n\nIt is clear that this particular franchise owner is not the same one that owns the location at Lone Mountain & Decatur, as that McD's is always spotless and has fully functioning equipment at all times. \n\nOnce again, I give strong accolades to the service staff of this location. People like Damon are why I gave this review a 2/5 as opposed to a 1/5."}
{"text":"I don't eat at McDonald's often, but I had a craving for their frozen lemonade drink. One worker greeted me at the door as I walked in, the cashier was very polite and everyone of the employees was actively working either completing orders or cleaning. I was kinda impressed with seeing a crew work together like they did on this visit. Not room for complaints with anything at all, kudos to the team there."}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever seen! They act like you're bothering them. I'll drive an extra couple of miles to go to another McDonald's. or just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"In a business transaction I expect product delivered as well as service. This location doesn't get that concept.\n\nI've come to McDonalds because I'm in a hurry and there aren't other options. Like most of us do. \n\nWhen they leave half my food out of the bag and then I have to spend five minutes on the phone explaining the problem over and over to someone with no communication skills (why are people who don't understand English answering the phone?) AND how other places rectify problems, offer an apology, give solutions, etc. it's beyond bad. \n\nAvoid at all costs!\n\nIf you have to go here check your bag before leaving!"}
{"text":"No bacon on my Bacon and Cheese Quarter Pounder!!!!! Kind of an essential ingredient for that particular burger...."}
{"text":"It's a McDonalds- no surprises for food you're not going to find a lot of healthy food or anything that high of quality. It's a pretty clean restaurant with nice customer service."}
{"text":"The drive-through staffs are unbelievably stupid. \n\nHe verbally confirmed my order twice, yet still give me the wrong meal. How can he possibly confirms that I ordered Sausage, Egg & Cheese McGriddles, but give me Steak, Egg & Cheese Biscuit.\n\nThis happened many times."}
{"text":"Tastes great if you're starving but your stomach says \"you'll be oh so sorry\" afterwards. Not a lot of healthy choices, sky-high calorie counts, and your money is going to a gigantic corporation rather than supporting your local community. At least they're going to start posting the calories at the cashier but don't be fooled. Even if you order a salad, the dressings have about 18 grams of fat! Anyway, there are so many other wiser choices even when you're in a hurry. Methinks not unless you need WIFI in a pinch."}
{"text":"Meh mcd. I'm a big mcd fan but I'm not very impressed with this mcd. I've been there many times n i think what makes a mcd standout is their service and cleanliness because all mcd serve the same food! I went there many times already. Their ketchup / fountain station is always messy, one time i wanted to get me some ketchup and once i pumped it out. .multiple fruit flies just zoooom went everywhere.......   it was so gross that i can clearly remember it. \n\nFood is okay its average. Nothing bad. One day i wanted to grab a coffee and work on my laptop elegantly at mcd ... i realized their WiFi never works. :/ yikes."}
{"text":"So much better after the renovation. The only thing I hate is the parking. Well... unless you want to pay, there is limited parking during peak hours. \n\nAnother plus is they are opened 24 hours. It's nice when you are craving some artery clogging fries in the middle of the night. Can't say much about the rest of the food. It's typical fast food/Mcd's after all. \n\nService was fast the last time we were here."}
{"text":"Went in last weekend. The place was absolutely TRASHED - like food garbage on every single table there. When we went to order food they told us they were switching over to the breakfast menu, so I ordered an item of the breakfast menu, and they told me they only had coffee and fries, but I could wait for half an hour. While I was there, the staff discovered a phone on the counter that had been left by someone. It rang a minute later and they laughed to each other about throwing it out and/or not answering."}
{"text":"I only went here for an ice cream cone on a hot summer day!\n\nService was fast, pleasant and with a smile.\n\nThe place was fairly clean and the washrooms are relatively clean compared to other comparable restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This McDonalds is a nice place to come for a quick bite to eat and to satisfy your craving for greasy big macs and addictive fries. Nuggets are my favorite with sweet and sour sauce! This location is always busy but still very efficient. The staff works quickly and effectively. They have free wifi and parking is almost non existent unless you park on a side street and walk.  Overall this Mcdonalds really is not that bad for being at such a busy intersection."}
{"text":"Do not come here. Extremely dirty and the hot chocolate gives you diarrhea. Wet floor and the bathroom has no toilet paper."}
{"text":"5 minutes wait for a coffee and a muffin! The new automated system does not work!!! McDonald's needs to change it back to their old system, much faster."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is handy for anyone in the Yonge and Sheppard area, but be wary of the post last-call crowd pouring themselves into the restaurant on Fridays and Saturdays. It's always busy. They have talking garbage cans--not sure why. Otherwise, it's a McDonald's!"}
{"text":"I was in a hurry tonight so decided to stop here to grab something on the way home.\n\nThis McDonald's is brand new now, so it's clean and nice looking.\n\nI had Chicken McNuggets and French Fries.  They were pretty much the same as they always are.  It's McDonald's.\n\nMy order did take much longer than usual.  They said they were waiting on the nuggets.  We'll see how it is if I go back again.  I was on a health kick until today, so let's hope that my visits here aren't frequent."}
{"text":"If you like MickyDs than this one is not bad.  I don't usually eat at McDonalds but I went in for a coffee.  There is usually a big crowd during office lunch hour.  This is a brand new store and very clean.  No parking though as it's on the busy intersection of Sheppard and Yonge."}
{"text":"i got a big breakfast this morning to go only to realize that the guy didn't give me a hash brown when i got home.  that's like me getting a big mac combo and u forgot my fries....dafuq????"}
{"text":"Went here a few times the last time a while back. I hear they are closing stores is this one on the chopping block? It a piece of prime real estate right across from City Center. \n\nI can't tell you how many times I was happy to have this as a cool air conditioned refuge with a soda fountain you could go back to a couple times on a hot day. If you walk the strip a few miles in the 110 degree heat you will know what I mean. A tiny $1 bottle of water from 7/11 isn't going to cut it.\n\nThis particular McDs has some interesting characters that hang around it... as you probably know. Inside is equally fun. A mix of people from all over the world and what looks like a few natives.\n\nI've seen some Christian evangelists here too, you know the ones that are handing out bible versus... apparently they need a break too."}
{"text":"Came here several times for breakfast and had the Egg McMuffin every time - as it comes, with white cheddar instead, and with egg whites subs. The meal option is great b/c you get that muffin with the nutrition (protein!) and re-fillable coffee, as well as a little crispy hash brown cake. The apple pies are cheap (2 for $1) and overly sweet for my taste buds."}
{"text":"Yes, we stopped here to grab a late-night burger.  The group didn't feel like shelling out tons of dough for a proper restaurant meal when we just wanted a snack.  It just wasn't the cleanest and most pleasant of places to sit and eat.  You have been forewarned:  all sorts of odd-looking customers run in and out of this McDonald's."}
{"text":"only went there after 4am and the was ridulous! thats wassup!"}
{"text":"Late night snack after a fun night of partying on the strip! Food was fast and everything great until I noticed a long black hair stuck in my burger patty.... Needless to say I didn't finish eating my meal."}
{"text":"Minus all the weird drunks, this is a great 24/7 location if you have the munchies..."}
{"text":"The only two reasons I would review a fast food restaurant are good or bad service experiences. I had a great experience here. I ordered two Spicy McChickens (wish they had this in CA), 10 McNuggets, and fries. Since I had to wait a long time for my order, however, I received a bunch of freebies that I didn't even ask for: a large soft drink, 10 more McNuggets, and another Spicy McChicken. Hehe I love these victories."}
{"text":"Go to McDonalds to get what you expect. Cheapest meal on the strip. Split the 20 piece nuggets with my mom and got two double cheeseburgers (which we didn't even eat, hello breakfast!) for $7! wouldn't be so excited normally but paying upwards of $30 a person made me really appreciate what McDonalds has to offer. For $5 more, this one offers 2 complete meals. Go here for a cheap meal anytime."}
{"text":"Service is really good here. Especially the black guy who always smiles at customers when taking orders. I ordered only a cheeseburger and asked if I should pay to get drinking water refills at the drink station (all thanks to NYNY for not even having a simple water dispenser), he said \"Nah, you don't have to pay. Just go get it,\" and gave me a free cup. For the $1.40 I paid for the burger, this level of service is amazing. This guy should be promoted cos he makes customers feel so welcomed."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of McDonald's... this particular one, however, not so much.  We waited in a long line around 9pm just to deal with not-so-friendly service.  I have to get honey with my chicken nuggets and according to the staff, they don't have it.  They were also \"sold out\" of milkshakes.  Have you ever heard of a McD's selling out of milkshakes?  Think not.  The soda/condiment area was dirty, so much that I almost skipped the ketchup.  We sat outside on the patio, even though it was a bit chilly, to avoid the odd stench inside.  This is the worst McD's I've ever been in.. and that's a big feat."}
{"text":"Was excited Monte Carlo had a 24 hour McDonalds right by the lobby, and our first meal (*snack) was here. The only reason why I am writing this review is they have a $1 menu, and the mini meals. Also, they don't have the McChicken, but a hot and spicy McChicken, which I hadn't seen, and it is GOOD. and SPICY! I also saw they had the double cheeseburger still for $1, which it isnt in CA, or at least the one I go to.\n\nQuick and fast!"}
{"text":"Cheers to the staff that knew how to maintain control of the customers that seemed to be disorganized and not really standing in an organized line. They did their job and got our orders out in good fashion. I can't expect them to be exited to be dealing with drunk partiers and gamblers but they really did a good job. \n\nAs for the food..... It's McDonald's!!! It serves the purpose."}
{"text":"'only in vegas\" was what i said to stacy's mom in car next to us when she asked 'bout our 50pc mcnuggets happy meal lookalike box.\n\nthey're 24/7. and this definitely beats those after hours steak and eggs. maybe?\n\nand only in vegas where manager treats their nuggets like gold. he yelled at his cashier when she didnt answer his repeated question \"is this theirs? hey is it really theirs?\" yes i did remind him"}
{"text":"We tried the Bellagio Buffet and the Wynn Buffet, nothing worth those around $50 per person. But McDonald's is always McDonald's, cheap and fast and fair price."}
{"text":"So a few cocktails may have inspired some \"it's-midnight-and-I-NEEEEEED-some-McD's\" munchies.  \n\nHowever, this McD's was right next door to our hotel and it really hit the spot.  It's easy to stumble to....I mean, find...  And it was hot and fresh.\n\nWhat I did not appreciate was the fact that when I checked the bag ( I am SO glad I always check the bag, and here's why), they were missing a medium fries AND a big mac.  Not cool.\n\nThen when I brought it to their attention, there was no apology, no eye contact, there were actually no words whatsoever.  They just put the missing items in the bag and walked away.  Umm.  Thanks?"}
{"text":"\"Can't believe I'm rating a fast food joint...\"\n\nThis review is for rating McDonalds only!\n\nI'm not positive why California McDonalds cannot be like this one.  I'm not sure if it's like all of this throughout Las Vegas, but this is one sure delicious McDonalds.  This is because one item on there dollar menu.  I do not care this is fast food!  I live off this for the whole Halloween weekend.  This and cranberry and pomegranate juice.\n\nNo need for fancy buffets, when the Hot N Spicy comes as a luxury because it's not served in California.  Yes, they actually use the word spicy correct in a restaurant.  Because this sandwich did have a kick to it.  Here in the states, usually when it says spicy - the word spicy usually means American spicy.  American spicy is like a Asian person's mild.  This had an Asian kick of mild/spicy.\n\nNow lets talk about the crisp.  The crisp of this sandwich was definitely there.  Every single bite, was a crunch, crunch, and crunch.  Hot steamy buns, tossed with some mayo and lettuce and I was set.  This was just goodness coming out of fast food.\n\nIf you like the McChicken, and you like spice... This is the perfect sandwich for you.  No need to go home and add saracha.  You will get the spice built into the batter. Just chomp chomp and chomp.  And be satisfied."}
{"text":"Not fair that the meal prices are bumped up because its located on the strip. (But i actually never went inside so Im getting this feedback from my cheap brother!)\nThumbs up that its located on the strip though!\nLittle scary as I sat in the parking lot and watched bums and the night crew doing the trash run. Looked dirty from the outside..but i was outside! \n\nHey it was late..I ate the food. They served the purpose I needed."}
{"text":"HUUUUUUUMPH.\n\nBoyfriend and I..... drunk....walked past by this branch and all of a sudden wanted a double quarter pounder with cheese and a 20pc nuggets.\nI also for some reason wanted a double cheeseburger with extra onions.\n\nWe had the bag and been munching on the fries on our long walk to Mandalay...only to find out...they didn't put my double cheeseburger in the bag..but charged me for it. HUUUUMPH!\n\nDont' do that to me when I'm drunk."}
{"text":"I REALLY enjoyed the service \nThe people who worked here were so friendly and polite and greeted everyone who came in the door\nLooked like a bunch of friends working together\nThe food was good cooked properly and I didn't have to wait long in line\n\nI really enjoyed this McDonald's \nWay to go guys!"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm 10 years old.... AND my friend John takes me here like.... EVERY week so.... I always get the 6 pc. Chicken nugget kids meal with sweet n sour sauce AND WHAT DO I GET FOR A DRINK? Lemonade. If you have a child, get them the kids meal! MCDONALDS IS SOOOO DELICIOUS! THE BEST FOOD EVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good location.. prime place to go for us college students trying to eat small and bet big. I was impressed with their seating area: outside, inside, and upstairs. My favorite part was coming in around 11, and they were still serving breakfast! Other then that, it's just your average McDonald's."}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's ever. Full of drunk people off the strip. Bums hang around inside and outside the restaurant. Hookers and pimps hang out there. The employees are loud and ghetto and very unprofessional. Go to the nicer McDonald's by Planet Hollywood instead."}
{"text":"A typical Las Vegas Strip dive. Full of drunks looking for greasy food at night. Filthy dirty inside. Soda machines are all out of carbonation. My wife had to wipe the seats and table herself before we sat. She even put down a layer of napkins before sitting. To top it all off something is dripping out of the ceiling. I gave it two stars because it's exactly as I imagined it from the outside view and it's cheap.  Plus the grease is a great remedy for a twisted tummy after a long hard night of drinking."}
{"text":"After a good night at the club me and my friends wanted to grab some grub before we knocked out for the next day. We went to club Pure that night so what did we see across the street? A huge ass M which meant food so we were there. \n\nSo i guess it's a 24 hour McDonalds and i would honestly hate to work there because you are guaranteed to get drunk people every night. One of the employee's job was to make sure no one brought alcoholic drinks inside the restaurant which i have to say sucks. \n\nIt was around 2:30am and the lines were pretty long. I guess everyone had the same idea as we did. It took kind of long since some of the drunk people in front of us could hardly function, but it was understandable. Annoying, but understandable. So i finally ordered my food and had a wait for a while because they were busy. \n\nSince we were staying at Treasure Island we figured we could just walk down that way and cross there. Apparently i was too drunk to realize and totally forgot that you can only cross at the Harrahs, or all the way down at the Encore. So we headed toward the Encore and we had to back track a couple of blocks. We could have just gone back to the Harrahs and crossed and save about 10-15 mins..but whatevs... \n\nAnyways, it was clean, legit, and you get to take an escalator to get to the restaurant. How fun when you are drunk!"}
{"text":"After a crazy night in Vegas, this is the funniest place to end up at the end of your night. At around 3am, 100% of the patrons here are incredibly drunk and under the influence of something. Everyone in line is just squirming around. My gf and I stood behind a bunch of college kids making out. Hilarious? Yes. Delicious? No...\n\nOn to the food. It really is your average fare. Not much different than any other McDonalds. Like a fugly hook up in the morning, you wake up the next day wondering why you had Mickey D's in the first place. OH! That's right, you were drunk!"}
{"text":"All you Barney stalkers out there know I don't generally review chains - unless one sticks out.  Here, friends, one of those exceptions.\n\nAfter a very 'successful' (read: long) night, I stumbled my way from mid-strip to Mandalay to crawl into my air-conditioned room around 7am.  I passed this McDonalds and the adjoining Fatburger and noticed with glee the 'open 24 hours' sign.  I didn't partake, but noted the location for a future evening.\n\n2 nights later a shake craving hits, so a mosey in here is in the cards, this time at a more respectable 10pm.\n\nOpen door\n\nWalk in\n\nAnd I notice the lack of a momentary bright splash of light, any whooshing noise, or even a change in air pressure.... All the things Hollywood would have you believe happens when you are instantly transported to an other-worldly place.  Because say what you will, but this place is not on Earth.  Odd beings wandering randomly, seemingly without purpose, busy the entire space of this establishment.  The only thing mssing from this HellBoy recreation of a burger joint was someone breathing through gills - but truth be told, I spent all of 5 minutes in this place so I might have just missed Fish Dude.\n\nThe shake was the same taste as that which is typically found on the third planet from the sun - and likely contained the exact same unidentifiable, unpronounceable ingredients as what you get at any McD's back home.  But I dare you to come here and not demand some frequent flier miles for the trip."}
{"text":"just cause it's right here on the main strip, doesn't mean that the service is better. try getting your food in 10 minutes from the time of your order."}
{"text":"This place was an oasis. A mirage that turned out to be real. We walked for what seemed like hours in the blistering Vegas wind. Trudging slowly, like two novice drinkers, deprived of water weight and nourishment. \n\nOnce we arrived it felt just like McDonalds at home. +1 smelly bum that sat behind us. Hey, bums gotta sit too. But man he was smelly.\n\nWe got breakfast there and were able to gamble playing Monopoly at the same time. We won another breakfast sandwich. I love McDonalds."}
{"text":"Pros: Spicy McChicken $1. Really good. A specialty late night snack on the strip. Fast service.\n\nCons: Very dirty. Tons of bums. Line can go down the stairs on some nights. They run out of certain foods. Machines break down.\n\nWhat else do you expect in the middle of the strip?"}
{"text":"I do not like McDonald's. However, I am must rate this life- and money-saving institution at the Strip highly because it has served me well, and will continue to do so in all of my future visits.\n\nThe place is clean. The line is short (but then again, I can only vouch for the line between the hours of 0400 and 0700). SERVICE IS SWIFT. And before you sober up, you're out the door with your breakfast in tow.\n\nWhat must be commended the most here are the workers. These hardened fellows have seen the best and the very worst of the people of the Strip. These experiences have evolved them to be immune to blatant judgement of the victims and casualties of a good night in Vegas. So shame not my fellow Strip party goers - this is the place to order your 4am breakfast burrito. In Vegas for EDC? Make sure to stop by here to order something to eat to replenish your energy for the next night. I hear a smoothie goes down the easiest after a hard night of raving. The workers here will not judge your zombie gait and your wide-eyed gaze.\n\nFor these reasons, I thank you McDonald's for taking care of me and my peers."}
{"text":"It's a mcdonalds.  So many out there they everyone knows what to expect.  \n\nPros\n\nI liked this especially because it provided an inexpensive eating option while we were staying at the polo towers.  They had a great deal of 2 Big Macs for $4.44.  Located on the outside first floor of planet Hollywood.  \n\nCon\n\nDemographics that usually patronize this establishment."}
{"text":"This is one of the best McDonalds I've been to. It has been remodeled in the past few years, so it looks nice and it is kept clean as well. This was a great place for my sister and I to sit and cool off and get ice cream while the adults were playing a game downstairs. I think it was more than the McDonald's in my area (I think...), but it was well worth it-I saw it as paying a couple of extra cents to sit in an air conditioned place on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"50 piece nuggets for $9.99 and $0.50 cones?!\n\nOnly in Vegas! This is the perfect greasy food for your hangover cure!"}
{"text":"I just saw someone else review about 50 chicken nuggets for 9.99, I would've gotten that and split it with a bunch of drunk people if I knew.\n\nI did come here when it was 109 degrees outside on a June day, I was baking in that hot ass sun.  I came here for some french fries, a few Snack Wraps (grilled and fried Ranch and Honey Mustard, thank you) and for a fucking Mocha Iced Coffee.  I was cheaper here than it was in NY, I was like I could drink this good ass tasting Mocha Iced Coffee every day, but no I didn't.\nConvenient location, I was staying right near here.  It sure did the job when I had a short walk back to Polo Towers on June 16th.  Great times, 24 hours too at this McDonalds, and only saw a few shady looking characters- NOT too many."}
{"text":"Best McDonald's ever!  Walked over after leaving a gambling binge.  The cashiers were friendly!\n\nPs they do not take chips as payment! Cash/credit only!!!!'"}
{"text":"It was okay customer service, and in a way I can;t believe I went here....Mc Donald's always somewhere where you can expect the usual prices, but the crowd was uncomforting to be around....felt like I was in a mix of a social security office in the poverty back when my family was struggling between advertising/dealing on the streets with flyers..but maybe I;m just being unkind, which I guess I am. At least the drinks were okay.....The thing hated most, the cheese! What the heck kind of cheese was this man? Government artificial cheese? Highly dissatisfied, made the whole burger unexceptional and sad on McDonald's management and Vegas part."}
{"text":"I definitely needed a snack because i was drunk and there would be no time for dinner. Since I'm already spending all my money on drinking and gambling, I decided to go cheap on the meal so dollar menu it is. We go to the McDonalds on the strip with the Big Golden Arches, can't miss it. We order and two seconds later my Hot and Spicy McChicken was ready. It was hot and right off the grill. They customer service is fast and friendly.\nWe decided to walk around instead of sitting in the dining area, but it looked as if there was plenty of space to sit down."}
{"text":"Went here one morning right before going sky diving. Had a good experience. Like all McDonalds, service was good, food was good. Nice and spacious seating area."}
{"text":"It was a normal average meal but me and my friend had to charge our phone and the Asian housekeeper was being really petty and tried to get us kicked out by telling security. Bathroom was disgusting as any other mcdonalds. Just to be clear security wasn't that petty and my phone was charged well. I have never been so annoyed with an employee."}
{"text":"This McDonalds is like any other McDonalds...  however, this one gets 4 stars because it is a NEVADA McDonalds... which means it has the SPICY McCHICKEN! \n\nEvery time I go to vegas, I stop in at a McDonalds just for the spicy mcchicken.... they don't have it on their Cali menus and its oh so much better hot and spicy! Perfect cheap drunk/sober food."}
{"text":"It's a McDonald's. On the strip. Open 24 hours.\n\n$5 bucks for 20 piece chicken nuggets at 3am after dancing and drinking with my girls at Drai's?\n\nCLUTCHHHHHHH."}
{"text":"This is a great location right on the strip and not as run down as most others.\nWhy eat McDonalds when there are millions of super exclusive only in Vegas options?\nBecause the food is expensive as hell, because you gambled all your money away, cuz your drunk as shit and a dollar burger will hit the stop right about now?\nWhatever it is, they are there for you 24/7 and they sure hit the spot for me NEEDING an egg McMuffin after a long booze filled Vegas night.\nThat and their new chocolate chip frappe.\nI was on my way to Coffee Bean and Tea leaf for an ultimate Mocha when i stopped to get the McMuffin here, my husband got  the chocolate chip frappe and it was so good that we got two more.\nBest damn thing McDonalds ever did and for that i am a fan!"}
{"text":"I love the location of this McDonalds and the amount of sitting room inside. Opens 24 hours Vegas style! Fast and efficient service. The guy at the counter was actually really nice to me and helped me quickly. Great place to go to for a late night snack after the club, lounge, show, night of frivolous gaming.\n\nWhy I Knocked 1 Star: I was sad to find out, however, that their ice cream (and anything related to it) closes at 12 midnight. In my opinion, that's a bit early for Vegas and I had to settle with a bottle of Minute Maid juice which ran $2.69. Better to just grab juice downstairs or tip the waitress at the casino and have some fun at the penny slots."}
{"text":"I've had a number of Spicy Chicken sandwiches before but I must admit that at this McDonalds, these sandwiches are spicy!! \n\nFresh french fries? Not here... they were as cold as cold can be. Very disappointing.\n\nOverall, it was a decent place to grab a cheap ice cream cone and a sandwich to try and not spoil being hungry for dinner time at Benihana!"}
{"text":"This place threw me off... with their single yellow arch that stretched onto the street. Somehow in my second hand smoke induced state, I found the single arch humorous. Ended up satisfying my craving for fries at a normal decent price. Also, this location sells SPICY McChickens! Mmmm... I haven't seen that in California! Also carries Cherry Pies too!"}
{"text":"You MUST try this place if you come to Vegas!  First, the burgers are awesome, whether you get the regular hamburger or the huge quarter pounder, they are juicy and delicious and prepared exactly as you want them. They cook them in advance so you don't have to wait very long. \n\nI ordered their specialty burger, which is called the Big Mac, boy does the name fit. It comes with two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, all on a sesame seed bun. Simply amazing. \n\nYou should also get their fried potatoes, which are called French Fries. Not sure what is French about them, but they sure are delicious, especially with the tomato based dipping sauce. \n\nThey have a fried fish sandwich which features a tender and moist fillet of locally caught cod. You can get it with or without cheese. \n\nI haven't tried everything on the menu yet, but I recommend ordering one of their creatively packaged combo deals. They all come with the main sandwich, French Fries, and a drink. You can get a soft drink or one of their delicious milk shakes.  I am pretty sure they are made with hand scooped ice cream. \n\nI will be sure to return to this restaurant next time I find myself on the Las Vegas strip and  want what is possibly the best dining experience around."}
{"text":"I know, I know.  It's a fast food joint...what is there really to say?  It's not like the food here is going to taste all that different than a McDonald's just about anywhere else.  So, with all of the great restaurants and buffets in Vegas to eat at and Yelp about, why the hell am I reviewing a McDonald's you ask?  Well, I'll tell you why:\n\n50 nuggets for $9.99.  (edit:  how awesome would it be if FIDDY CENT was FIDDY NUGGET?  Okay, anyways...haha).\n\nI know...crazy, right?  Now, you're probably thinking that's either (A) an amazing yet awesome deal, or (B) an amazing yet kinda disgusting one.  If you aren't really sure how you feel, figure it this way: if you're in line with your friends, riding a good buzz and feeling hungry in the middle of the night, you're probably thinking (A).  If you're pretty sober, waiting for your drunk friends to buy food and bring it to the table, you might find yourself leaning towards (B).  Now, if you're sitting there at the table, wondering how the hell you and your 11 friends ended up getting two orders, yet still find yourself having some because really, who is going to notice a few of the 100 or so missing, then...well, welcome to my world!\n\nKudos to them for staying open 24 hours and being there for my friends when we found out Pink's was closed.  And remember, sometimes it really is true that \"what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas\".  Just ask all those nuggets we left behind that we couldn't/refused to finish."}
{"text":"This place was such a big shock to us because of their 50 Chicken McNugget for $9.99 deal (which is sad now because the deal is now at ALL Mickey D's... so its not so special anymore).\n\nAnyways we came back from clubbing at Tao and we got our 100 nuggets, between the 4 of us. I loved seeing the kinds of people at that time... we saw workers who just got off their shifts, professionals, college kids in clubbing clothes like we were, grandparents... we're all different but we got two things in common.. our love for McDonald's and that we're in VEGAS!\n\nOh yeah.. the food, you should already know what Mickey D's food is like.\n\nOne star off for having a shady parking lot!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Mcfurry in the night there were not a lot of people and it took me about five minutes to wait for my ice cream. It's probably the cheapest food around."}
{"text":"I am in line for a Sausage McMuffin with Egg.  There are two lines and they are  at least 20 people deep. I am at the end.  This will take at least a half an hour. I talk to a woman in line who is from Georgia.  This is her first time in Vegas.  She tells me the trip was relatively affordable because they are splitting the cost of the room with her boss and friend. I ask her how she likes Vegas so far and she says she loves the artwork and all of the sculptures. I think an elitist might snicker at that, laugh at the fact that someone thinks they are viewing culture in such a material saturated town. She thinks what she sees are cultural artifacts and she is correct. This is America and this is where America comes to let loose, lose money and gawk at the lifestyles of the more fortunate in regards to both wealth and looks. \n\nI take my tiny bag and Diet Coke and sit at the counter alone. I eat my sandwich and wish I would have ordered a hash brown. I look out the window and see mainly elderly people have coffee and breakfast. I see some girls sitting at a table and they are all looking at their phones the others go inside to order and one stays behind looking through her LV purse for reasons none other than the fact she is uncomfortable sitting alone even for a few minutes. \n\nI throw my bag in the trash, walk out the door and choose the stairs over the escalator and think about the gondolas in The Venetian, the clouds on the ceiling and how the lights and mural make you feel like your outside when in fact you are in a mall similar to the ones you'd find in your own home town minus the opera singing actors and hyper-sexualized ads at every turn."}
{"text":"I used to despise McDonald's. The service was slow, the employees were rude, and worst of all, the food was greasy and incredibly unhealthy. Over time, McDonald's built up their image, introduced some healthy menu items, and slowly regained my interest.\n\nWalking down the strip, I was craving some affordable food. (Whoever said Vegas had cheap food must have lost their mind.) The arch bursting forth onto the sidewalk not only grabbed my interest, but made me incredibly excited to get a salad.\n\nWhen I walked in, the place was a lot of smaller than I would have expected, but there was only one person in front of me, so I figured it wouldn't matter since there wasn't a crowd. \n\nI placed my order and stood off to the side. The salads are usually made at the beginning of the day, and it takes less than a minute to grab the salad, the dressing, and plastic-ware. However it took over 20 minutes to get the damn thing. Not only that, but they tried giving me the wrong salad several times, then told me they were out of the dressing I requested, then blamed it on someone in the back kitchen. \n\nReally though, I'd rather overpay at one of the nicer casinos. Skip this place."}

{"text":"FIVE STARS, THREE WORDS:\n\nHOT N SPICY!\n\nThe only reason we came here was in search of the holy grail McChicken, the Hot N Spicy. We heard about it from some randoms, and we had never heard of it so went to check it out. It was tucked away in a corner, so it was never packed, always clean and had quick service. Why do they not have these in California? I'll never know, but I'll definitely hit this spot back up for late night drunken eats!"}

After helping the guy at the counter the employee then said \"last customer, we're closed.\" When I googled this particular store it said they closed at 11:00pm. I also called the front desk of the hotel to ask them. They also told me 11:00pm. My friends had already ordered and got their food so as I sat there with them I watched them turn away AT LEAST 25 people. The place was FILTHY!

They are not priced higher just because they are located inside a Hotel Casino in Vegas.  So that's a good thing.\n\nThere are plenty of tables for seating.  Nice spot to getaway from some of the craziness in the casino and/or children's games."}

I came in with my boyfriend at about 9:30pm and our order wasnt taken until 9:42pm but we didn't mind because there was only one cashier taking orders and big families in front of us.

Long story short we sat for more than an hour to receive our food and the only reason we didn't ask for our money back was because nobody was out in the front except for the cashier and the guy calling out the orders and we didn't want to cause a scene at this time. Never coming back!! You're better off going to the mc donalds next door its just a short walk and you save yourself the hour and a half wait."}

She said that why didnt I call?? I told her that I called the store but nobody picked up. Then she said why didnt I come back again . I said that it was 11:30 in the night. \nWell the thing which saddens me the most is that she can think that a customer would lie just for 2 dollars???? Really????? I mean grow up some brains."}

{"text":"Ich war heute das zweite Mal dort und bin nicht wirklich angetan. Mein Begleiter hat beim ersten Mal einen Big Mac bestellen wollen. Es hie√ü, es gibt keinen. Also bestellte er einen Mc Ripp und schimpfte w√§hrend wir auf das Essen warteten vor sich hin. Dies bekam auch die Schichtleiterin mit und erkundigte sich. Selbstverst√§ndlich gab es Big Mac. Da wir es bei der Bestellung belassen wollten, gab es als Wiedergutmachung 2 Apfeltaschen. Als mein Begleiter dann in seinen Burger bei√üen wollte, entdeckte ich einen gro√üen gr√ºnen Schimmelfleck auf dem Br√∂tchen. Er ging sich beschweren und bekam eine weitere Apfeltasche. Angeblich hat ein Angestellter ausersehen das Blech mit den verschimmelten Br√∂tchen statt in den M√ºll in den Verkaufsraum gestellt. Heute kaufte ich ein Mc Flurry und bin total entt√§uscht. Das Eis schmeckt gsnz anders als √ºblich. Die Konsistenz war schon anders. Fast so als w√§re das Eis aus Wasser hergestellt. Es war gar nicht cremig sondern fast krisselig im Aussehen. Auch der Geschmack war fade. Abgesehen von den beiden Geschmackserlebnissen bei diesem Mc Donalds finde ich das Konzept, dass man an der Kasse nur kauft und zahlt und auf das Essen warten muss, bis die Nummer vom Kassenbon angezeigt wird, ziemlich ung√ºnstig. W√ºrde es an der Kasse schneller gehen, w√ºrde ich das vielleicht hinnehmen. Aber es dauert genauso lange an der Kasse, wie an anderen Mc Donalds Kassen, bei denen man das Essen gleich bekommt. Mc Donalds spart sich lediglich den Gang zum Gast, wenn das Essen nicht da ist und es an den Platz gebracht wird. Denn hier wartet der Gast wie auf dem Amt, bis seine Nummer gezogen wird."}
{"text":"Am Sonntag Nachmittag gingen wir zu Mc Donalds und tranken einen Caf√© im Mc Caf√©.\n\n\n F√ºr den Beitrag hier, fotografierte ich im Mc Donalds, doch schon gleich beim ersten Bild schrie der wahrscheinlich Manager von einer hinteren Ecke zu mir:\" Fotografieren verboten!\" Ich fragte ihn wieso, doch er war zu keiner Diskussion oder Information breit.\n\n\n Wir lie√üen uns nicht beirren und gingen zur Mc Caf√© Theke. Hier mussten wir warten, bis die Theken-kraft kam.\nWir bestellten uns Das Caf√© Men√º, ein warm Getr√§nk und ein Kuchen nach Wahl f√ºr 3,99 Euro.\nBei der Bestellung schaute die Theken-Kraft mit einer Mischung aus gelangweilt und w√ºtend. Als ich an der Bestellung war, sagte ich. Bitte einmal das Cafe Men√º mit einen Erdbeerkuchen.... die Dame sagte in einem harschen aggressiven Ton: \"was Trinken\"\n\n\n Wir gingen mit unserem Kaffee mit Kuchen zu einem freien Tisch, was sich aber als schwierig gestaltete, weil viele Tische nicht abger√§umt waren.\nHier stapelten sich Tablette. \nAuf dem Boden waren ebenfalls Essensreste zu finden.\nAuf der R√ºckseite der braunen Sessel befanden sich bei einigen Spritzflecken von Getr√§nken.\n\n\n Zur abschlie√üenden Kr√∂nung war das Erlebnis der Toilette.\nIm ersten Stock befinden sich die Toiletten, davor sitzt eine Klo-Frau die Geld f√ºr die Benutzung erwartet.\nIch finde es schon alleine eine Frechheit von Mc Donalds Geld f√ºr den Toilettenbesuch zu verlangen, weil die Kosten der Toilette schon im Preis der Waren eingerechnet ist.\nEine noch gr√∂√üere Frechheit ist allerdings, das unsaubere Klo. Der Boden, der beim gehen klebte usw....\nDie absolute Kr√∂nung ist allerdings, das beim H√§nde waschen keine Papiert√ºcher sind. Diese muss man dann bei der Klo-Frau abholen... zwei St√ºck pro Person gibt es dann... daf√ºr erwartete die Dame allerdings auch ein Trinkgeld... unglaublich !!\n\n\n Der Service, die Freundlichkeit, die Sauberkeit.... alles dies geht hier gar nicht.\nSo etwas habe ich bei einem Mc Donalds noch nie erlebt."}

Fries tasted as if the oil from 1987 was used and the chicken nuggets were fine in terms of taste but not hot, letting me know they too had been there for a little while.  The filet o'fish didn't taste good either, according to my hubby and I'm assuming it was the same old oil used on the fries.  Disappointing to say the l"}
{"text":"All the staff here except for the guy taking orders was joking around with each other, messing around and laughing like there ain't no tomorrow. Its a good thing that they enjoy themselves, but they didn't care about customers at all. I asked if they had protein style burgers, and they said yes. So i ordered a lettuce wrap/ protein style big mac. What I got was a slap of meat with a slap of unmelted cheese on top, some pieces of pickle underneath a stale piece of lettuce and some more shreds of lettuce, in a salad container. They put the container in a paper bag and threw it on the counter. The contents were scattered everywhere inside the container so the server was nice enough to give me a fork and a knife. It was a pretty hilarious experience!"}

{"text":"Contrary to what both McDonald's corporate and Yelp says, they do not stay open until 10:00pm, the manager decides on a random times to close each night. Sometimes it's 8:30, sometimes 8:45, it's random. They also claim the airport tells them what time they have to close each night. If this is true, why are the other places open? Tonight they closed at 8:43, turning away 3 customers (including me). Guess I won't have McDonald's again. No wonder other places are doing better.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the benefits of posting on Yelp is that we get to relieve a bit of frustration when confronted with poor service at an establishment on the oft chance that management or owner may be reviewing these.\n\nThis morning I visited this MCD for a large iced mocha at 6:00 am. This is located in the Phoenix Airport so the patrons frequenting these places in the airport are time conscious as I was this morning. The place was not busy with maybe 5 customers being served while I stood there for 23 minutes. Finally I asked where order #118 was and the girl acted like I was not there. Did I become invisible? No eye contact and no response. She continued to serve up the orders and after a few more minutes I asked again \"excuse me ... can you find out where order # 118 is?\" And I showed her my receipt with #118 in large print. She said \"oh\" and took my receipt to read it. I said it's an iced mocha. She asks \"what size?\". My initial thought was you're reading the receipt but I replied \"large\", non-fat\". No apology and no confirmation but at least she's preparing the order. Then, when it is done - mind you it is now almost 30 minutes for the order - she just hands it to me. No apology. No reason for the delay. \n\nIf I did not need to catch the flight I might have actually said something to the management instaed of writing this. So now I get to vent because of Yelp with the hope that it makes me feel better. And it does to a degree.\n\nThen I think - the Stabuck was just two gates away. Maybe it's me who needs to use better judgment - why did I pick MCD over Starbuck for iced mocha? Would I go to Starbucks for hamburgers?"}
{"text":"The only thing saving this from one star is the sandwich I got.  It was their typical crunchy chicken sandwich, but it was actually pretty good- decent bun, good chicken, good veggies.\n\nHowever... the rest of the experience was awful.  It was not fast food- they could not keep up with a small crowd.  There were three people in line ahead of me, and a half dozen waiting for their orders.  There is no seating since it's at the airport, and no really good place to stand- and since so many people were standing around, people approaching weren't sure where the line was.\n\nSeriously, how does a McDonald's not know how to keep up, and how do they run out of so much on a Monday?  They kept running out of fries, and ours were barely cooked.  They were completely out of other items on their limited menu.  The girl who took my order was not friendly, and didn't know the menu, and screwed up my order.  I ordered a large fry with spicy mustard sauce for Sweetie, and a chicken sandwich combo for myself.  We did not get the large fry, but since they were out and I didn't want to wait longer I just gave Sweetie mine.  They are lucky she was not there with me, is all I have to say.  Every customer was grumbling; she would have told McDonald's exactly what they were doing wrong, and hurt some employees' feelings.  To be fair, it may have been more a management/efficiency issue, but no one seemed to know what they were doing."}
{"text":"I am giving this place a 5 star review for the time and place.\n\nWe were between flights.  We walked ALL THE WAY AROUND Sky Harbor to come to McDonalds.  The line was a little long, but the McDonalds is really really small.  In fact, we actually sat in the sandwich shop tables next door.\n\nThe staff did seem harried, and made apologies for the wait.  I did not feel it was excessive, so whatever.\n\nHad the smokehouse bacon burger and it was just fantastic.....yes you heard it....fantastic.  Best burger I had eaten from anywhere in quite awhile.  The flavor and texture of the cold parts (lettuce tomato) were really good.  Fries were perfect.  That meal totally hit the spot and if it was nowhere a fast food place could not care because audience is relatively captive.  Both me and my wife felt the burgers were exceptional.\n\nYes, I give the meal and staff that day a 5 star, I did tell the manager on duty the same.  The date was 5/3/15 at about 5 or 6? in the evening."}
{"text":"Great to finally have a McDonald's here at the airport. \"Street prices\" posted and food is good along with all the drink options. Service is quick and coffee is hot!"}
{"text":"We were here on 11/15/16. They don't serve breakfast all day like all the other mcdonalds, they were out of fries and the line was crazy. Hope that other travelers have a better experience! Options were limited at our gate area but we did make the long walk elsewhere."}
{"text":"Gross! I came here for breakfast and the food was dry and rubbery. I also tried to order coffee, all they had to drink was tea?"}
{"text":"This place is clean and staff is friendly!\n\nPlay area is always well kept as well as the bathrooms!\n\nGreat location right off of Craig and the 95 freeway.\n\nGreat getaway if you don't want to be outside in the Vegas heat!"}
{"text":"Happy 2015! Let's see how many fast food places I can review this year!\n\nThis McDonald's was recently renovated. The new indoor play place is awesome. It's like a three level mini gym for kids complete with obstacles and a slide. There's even a toddler area with interactive musical instruments that are surprisingly loud. My 2 1/2 year old daughter has a great time playing here and it's a convenient option when the weather is less than perfect to enjoy an outdoor playground or one of the nice parks in the NW. I'm not sure how it compares to other fast food play places but it's the first I've seen of its kind.\n\nThe food? You're not supposed to eat that garbage. Didn't you see Super Size Me? I stopped eating it in the 90s when a Beanie Babie collecting-relative fed me countless Happy Meals because she needed the Teenie Beanie toys that were included at the time. Or was it the time I discovered an unidentifiable blue object in a chicken nugget at a Girl Scouts event and became a vegetarian? Ah, food memories. I did enjoy the white chocolate mocha that was recently discontinued and I have a weakness for the warm strawberries and cream pie. Limited time only!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was bummed when they closed down to renovate because I stop daily before getting 12 year old from school. They are all so friendly and quick. The store looks beautiful and will be coming every afternoon now that they are open again"}
{"text":"These people want 15 an hour???? Rude stupid and out right nasty. The food was cold and gross. Right away I asked for no onions and no tomatoes and of course they were both on my burger so I Turned it in right away and asked for a sauce and they rudely replied saying its 16 cents right after he handed a young lady 3 of them when she only ordered fries and a burger. Tables were dirty and the napkins and ketchup cups were out of stock."}
{"text":"There isn't much to say about McDonalds that you don't already know. However, this recently redesigned location is ideal for anyone with small children. With the exception of the occasional birthday party, the play place is never too crowded. There is only once entrance\\exit so it is easy to keep an eye on the kids without losing your mind. There is also a toddler area inside the play place for the really littles. The staff is friendlier than most fast food staff, they always bring my food to my table so so don't have to leave the kids unattended in the play area."}
{"text":"My son loves to go to the play place, usually the kids are nice, the parents are nice too. Employees are polite for the most part, bathrooms are clean. Sadly this area has more crime each time I come here so I just stopped going."}
{"text":"Like I have said before, having children makes it nearly a necessary thing to be at McDonalds about once a week. This isn't always for Happy Meals (we prefer home cooked food to fast food always - especially for our kids), but I don't mind treating him with a soft serve cone or a Sprite on the way home from the park, or maybe when he's been really good at the grocery store. They also tend to be a good caffeine fix for me when I don't feel like the Bux. \n\nThis McDonalds is on the way to \"Grandma's House\" so we make stops here more frequently than any other on this side of the valley. We've never encountered any problems more than the occassional broken straw here. Employees are generally pleasant. How much better could a Mickey D's get?"}
{"text":"If I told you that McDonald's was a big factor in my weight loss of 20 lbs last year, you probably wouldn't believe me. Not unless you are one of my coworkers that see me at work every morning eating my Sausage McMuffin and have witnessed my slimmer physique. \n\nWell, it's true. Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day and I found that skipping breakfast is not a good idea if you're trying to lose weight/get fit. Even though its not the most wholesome breakfast option, this is the quickest, cheapest way for me to get my morning meal.\n\nI am not writing anything about McDonald's that you might already know. I'm writing about this particular location. They are always super fast and efficient at the drive thru and every employee I've encountered over the past few years here are very friendly. I come here so often that I should just write a review and give kudos to the Mon-Fri morning crew for always getting my order out fast, quick and in a hurry before heading to work. Even when the drive thru lane is packed, they move it pretty quickly so I've never found myself sitting in my car for more than a few minutes.\n\nSo just in case you're wondering what I order every morning here it is: a sausage Egg White Delight and a medium sugar-free vanilla iced coffee. I automatically throw away one piece of the muffin to save on carbs. I know it sounds crazy but it works. For me, a carb conscious way of life works best. And this keeps me satiated enough until I have to nuke my Lean Cuisine around noon time."}
{"text":"Ok so I went to Starbucks inside Albertsons just as they are closing...ugh...no worries someone tells me. \"Theres a Starbuck's at the other end of the parking lot\". Happy, I went back to work and on next break I walked to the Starbucks....ugh!!! They JUST closed!! Well Jack in the Box was across the street so I tried them...desperately seeking a carmel mocha frappuccino, the cashier say \"I'm sorry, all we have is iced coffee. I think Mc Donalds does though\". (across the street). I'm thinking...is this really worth the chase?? ...mmmm.... To my surprise I LOVE their carmel frappe!!! Couldn't get carmel mocha but that was fine. I like the plain carmel better!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice McDonald's.  The place is always clean, the staff is friendly, and it usually isn't too crowded, except for the drive thru, which always has a long line any time of day it seems.  The inside seating area is always clean and well stocked.\n\nI come here with my daughter so she can play in their play area.  She is 18 months and loves all of the climbing this McDs has.  This play area is always nice and clean as well.  In fact when we are there, someone is always cleaning it or just finishing up cleaning the area.  They even go through the tunnels and all.  It is a nice place, especially on those blistering summer days when it is too hot to go to the park.\n\nMy only complaint would be that they hide the sweet tea behind the counter.  I am a sweet tea addicted and it is a little annoying to have to go up to the counter to get a refill, especially when you have to wait in line with everyone ordering.  I need my sweet tea fix and waiting just doesn't count it.  \n\nOverall, it is a nice McDonald's."}
{"text":"Update:  I am still not satisfied with how WBF runs their franchises, but in all fairness, I will add that WBF sent me a coupon for a free extra value meal because I was dissatisfied.  So I guess I will accept this, then return to McDonald's  until the extra $0.49 cents for each meal for extra sauce equals the worth of the coupon."}
{"text":"I have been eating McDonald's since I was a child. I was recently super happy McDonald's began serving Breakfast all day. However I was greatly disturbed on my last visit. \n\n\nI ordered Hotcakes, as I normally do. When they arrived, the Styrofoam plate was melted on the outside and the pancakes were melted into the plastic. I am not a scientist but I know cooking food on Styrofoam is extremely unhealthy. \n\nI was in disbelief, so I ordered another Hotcakes and watched to see how they were cooked. \nWhat I saw made me sick, They would just plop 3 pancakes on the Styrofoam and them microwave the hotcakes right on the Styrofoam plate. Melting the Hotcakes into the plate.\n\nI am still amazed by this. I wonder if this is McDonald's protocol, or the employee just being lazy. Anyways Eating McDonald's may be more carcinogenic than it appears ( which is bad) \n\nGo to McDonald's and watch them melt your food into Styrofoam!! Sounds Yummy?"}
{"text":"Honestly I go to this McDonalds way more than I should but they're always friendly and on it. I love this McDonald's."}
{"text":"Always very clean and the staff is nice. The new children's play place is great and very toddler friendly, I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Beware of this McDonald's at all costs our entire order was fked up. I have never been so upset going through fast food in my life. I would like to speak with Patrick, bc she refuses to replace my order after her not speaking English at all, she had me repeat my order 4 times and when we got home it was all incorrect and then proceeded to forget my chicken nuggets. But made sure to put the sweet and sour sauce in the bag dumbass. I called and she said yeah when you come back I said tomorrow I will just make something at home now! She said what time and when like uhm idk you forgot my order you idiot. Well then jenell had to have someone translate what I was saying to another Spanish speaking employee only to tell me too bad, you can't take one bite out of the food and return it we need all the food, okay so what you want me to do spit it out? She replies no, I cannot help you. You want your forgotten chicken nuggets you paid for? No, after I got home and everything else was screwed up I'm so upset. I have never been to a more incompetent McDonald's in my life, if we have to learn Spanish at my job as a secondary language why can't you understand YOU MESSED UP MY ORDER AND YOU NEED TO REPLACE IT I DID NOT ORDER THIS AND I PAID FOE EXTRA THINGS I DID NOT RECIEVE AND THEN TO TELL ME I HAD TO COME BACK OUT AGAIN TO GET ONLY MY NUGGETS???!!!! MY WHOLE ORDER WAS MESSED UP. HER NAME IS JANL TAQUITA OR SOMETHING AND I WILL BE SPEAKING WITH A GM ABOUT THIS, it's not about the dollar value it's my time, energy, and arguing along with my money wasted on something I never got like throwing it away and when I called she said oh yeah sorry I forgot about your nuggets. So why was sweet and sour in the bag you dipshttttttttttttttttt."}
{"text":"Tried to order a quarter pounder with extra pickles and they wanted to charge $.25 extra.  An additional $.25 for extra pickles??  You can go McFuck yourself"}
{"text":"this place blows! the drive thru girl is rude and worried about her moped out front instead of my order! she doesnt like my brittish accent and her boss tells me to be quiet while ordering! what the heck?! screw you alaina!"}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten there is quite awhile.  The fries and burger were very tasty.  But the service\nwas great...very polite and quick."}
{"text":"Yes, I often indulge myself with the fine cuisine that is found at my local McDonald's.  OK, OK really I try not to go there that often unless it's the only thing to eat or I'm hankerin' for a damn McNugget (which by the way I still HAVE NOT found which part on the chicken the nugget is on).  Addictive with Hot Mustard.\n\nI went here exclusively this day because of the current coupons that came in the mail.  There were a bunch of decent ones, particularly the ones that are promoting you try the new McCrap...oi...I mean McWrap.  This is almost as catchy as that 'Fishay, Fishay' song from the previous McDonald's food campaign for Fish McBites over the Easter season.  I swear if I see a wall of fish singing this tune to me at any location I will make like Grizzly Adams and run for the hills.  \n\nI took my McWrap coupon and waltz into my closest McDonald's.  The visit's coupon was for a free McWrap of my choice with the purchase of any menu item (including the $1 Value Menu).  I got me a $1 Sweet Tea (1/2 & 1/2 to avoid extra sugar) to go with my McWrap.  I chose the Chicken & Bacon McWrap, grilled.  Oi, why McDonald's thought this thing could compete with a $5 footlong from Subway I don't know.\n\nMy Chicken & Bacon McWrap was really MEH.  The chicken was ok but was on the cold side, and my bacon?  Damn stuff is the same thing they put on your typical McDonald's breakfast fare.  Skinny and not much flavor.  The chicken was warm enough that it completely wilted the Spring Mix type lettuce in my McWrap.  Either that...or the Spring Mix was not cold to begin with!  I hate that.  Overly soggy lettuce.  Bleech.  The tomatoes that came in my McWrap were warm as well.  Not to mention, I have a feeling my McWrap was made prior to my ordering because the tortilla it came in was showing signs of sogginess too.  Not made fresh me thinks!  These guys and their speed over quality sometimes.\n\nTaste?  I rather have a wrap somewhere else and pay a bit more.  The flavors just weren't that great to justify a regular price of $4 per McWrap.  If I didn't have this coupon I wouldn't have bothered trying it.  The best part about the McWrap was the damn box it came in!  It was cool & hip, and I felt like I was unwrapping a present when I tore through that seal.  But other than that, nothing.  I would have much rather used the coupon for a free Happy Meal with purchase.  I love those things!  But only when they come in the actual Happy Meal box with the Golden Arches handles, not in a friggin' paper bag.  Grrrrr....I hate it when my Happy Meal comes in a regular bag.  Makes me NOT happy.\n\nAnyway, this trip to McDonald's was a bit of a bust.  Was hoping to give them a chance with this new fandangled McCrap...darn it there I go again...McWrap, but it just didn't impress me.  If they were made upon ordering and with much fresher ingredients, and not sitting by a heat lamp then maybe it would have been a better experience.  Maybe I should hit up another McDonald's and give this thing another shot.  Well, at least I had a coupon for buy one Dipped Cone, get one free!  I double fisted that sucker all the way home!  Ok, I actually shared for once."}
{"text":"Yep I'm not super excited about eating the food here either, but when we do decide to eat McDonalds we come to this location. I like that I can bring my kid here to play and get out of the Las Vegas weather in the windy winter months or the scorching heat of summer. There're are always lots of kids to play with, and I like that they have free wifi so I can catch up on computer work while the kids play. The play place is usually always clean, and they always have sanitizing wipes available to use. \n\nToday I came here with my daughter and they were really busy. The guy that took my order inside stopped what he was doing to help me take my food to our table since I am in a wheelchair and it's hard for me to do. I thought it was kind of him to do since they were so busy. I rarely get that kind of consideration i really nice places let alone McDonalds. I was really impressed! I think I'm going to get his name. So, I can tell the boss. \n\nAll in all. This is a good place to come and hang out if you need an inexpensive indoor place to eat and play."}
{"text":"I love how fast I can get my morning coffee on my way to work! Yumm! Fast and kind service!"}
{"text":"Mcdonalds is mcdonalds as far as good goes. What separates them from each other is service. This mcdonalds has nooooo idea what that means. The emergency door was beeping like a smoke detector with a bad battery. Other people were complaining about the same beep, and some got up and left the playroom. Notified the manager of the issue and she acted uninterested and gave me a look of disgust because I bothered her during social hour. I wish I was kidding or exaggerating about her face. The look almost turned me to stone. Bad manager!!"}
{"text":"Count your change at drive thru.  Went there last week and gal gave me a dollar bill instead of a five I couldn't back up since a car was kissing my bumper so when I got to the second window I told that gal what happen and the manager wasn't any help either.  He told me if I want to wait while he counts the drawer I was upset knowing the change and receipt was still in my hand and he made me feel I was lying. I told him it's just 4 bucks that I got shorted and that cashier will definitely be over in her drawer...\n\nGave them another chance tonight and to my surprise ordered sundaes but was told no ice cream then I ordered the big breakfast with hot cakes but was told it's not available. They should redo the menu boards and stop saying All Day Breakfast? It's just laziness they probably cleaned the ice cream machine earlier then they should have and said no ice cream and too lazy to make the breakfast. So sad. They menu should be available all the way until they close. What's funny this is not the first time they don't have breakfast & ice cream. So lame.  Oh well there's other places around the area I can go to instead lame excuses. Duh!"}
{"text":"If it wasnt for breakfast all day they get a 1 star.  in a pinch, under hangry circumstances, i love this place, so 2 stars is fair.   no more than once a month, if you want to live a long and prosperous life....go to the gym or walk instead...bring water and trust me...."}
{"text":"I will never give mcdonalds another penny of my money! It was 12:30am  and we went to the one on ann and Drexel first and they weren't accepting debit cards so we go a mile over to craig and tenaya they not only upcharged us 3 bucks for extra tartar sauce and pickle they tried  to charge full price until we mentioned the 2 for 5 deal, they then had the  nerve to make us wait for cold fish with one or 2 pickles and no extra tartar for us to call and complain wanting us to drive back after their screw up. Too bad I love your iced mochas and breakfast,  but after that kind of service I'll pass. You frankly deserve negative stars after that crappy of service. P.d that's the 2nd time your ann location declined bank cards."}

{"text":"Restaurant review:\nHow can the McDonald's be so bad in champaign. We came here on a Sunday night excepting \"fast food\" since we had a couple of coupons for free medium fries and drink with the purchase of a large sandwich. I went ahead and ordered a bacon clubhouse burger with fries and a drink expecting that this may take a few minutes. 20 minutes afterwards they finally call my number. They decided it was a priority to serve all 4 cars in the drive thru before me. I have never had to wait so long for McD. Of course the new bacon clubhouse burger had a new bun and really the same type of meat. This was not worth waiting for 20 minutes. The manager had the audacity to congratulate the staff on a job well done after we were all served. READ MY LIPS, I AM NEVER GOING TO THIS MCDONALD AGAIN. You write a complain about it to McD and you get a nice call from Stacy from the regional branch. Really no fixes. To make matters worse they have a chaulk board saying 40 something days since the last complaint. Are you kidding me, this is one of the worst mcdonalds every.\n\nPro: None!\n\nCons: So slow, it should not be called fast food. Unapologetic. \n\nHidden gem:\nDollar + menu. But this is not worth the pain of visiting this place"}
{"text":"One word, awful I have been through on a few occasions only to have them screw up my order multiple times. I call the 1-800 number, they apologize and then that's it no contact from the owners or management team to apologize or anything. The managers are rude they are soooo SLOW. The crew does not pay attention to the customers too caught up in their conversations to deliver good service to the customer. NEVER EVER EVER WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY AT THIS LOCATION!"}

Then get attitude then to top it off they screw my order up ...like that was it ..i give u the benifit of the doubt what a joke i wait til i get home and pull my food out and its not all there ..go to call they want u to bring it back after paying a 20 dollar cab to sit through the drivethru and get attitude from the people on drivethru...im not in the mood and aint paying more money out on a cab cause that late no bus runs...so when u call about next day they want to get serious over a order that cost 6 dollars ..so if you ask my opinion customer service sucks ther drive thru is ridicolus and there food may not all be in the bag..or not the way u want it .....and they dont care"}
{"text":"McDonald's isn't a great place to eat and never will be. The service is rarely friendly or accommodating. I go to McDonald's expecting to be treated like I'm bothering the employees with my presence and to have sub-par food, but my experience at this McDonald's was BEYOND bad service. It was down right terrible. My boyfriend and I went to get a couple parfaits to enjoy after grocery shopping. We ordered, pulled up to the window, paid for our parfaits and were told to pull forward because it would take a few minutes to get them ready. We watched all four cars behind us get food and leave. We waited oh so very patiently for fifteen more minutes. It was late so only the drive-thru was open. We could not go inside to see what was up. So, we reversed back to the window. Inside we could see three employees just standing around. My boyfriend knocked on the window to get their attention and all three of them looked at us and walked away out of view. We waited another 10 mins, bringing our total wait time to about half an hour, before one of them came to the window to tell us they were out of the stuff to make parfaits. Why, in God's name, did it take half an hour to tell us that? The only reason we got a refund was because we refused to leave until we got one. They didn't offer any kind of condolences for making us wait that long. They seemed annoyed with us for actually sticking around to get our food. I'm convinced that they thought by walking away from the window, it would get us to give up and drive away. No, you took my money and didn't give me anything. So rude."}
{"text":"All I can say is this is this is the WORST Mcdonalds ever.... Rude Manager, rude cashier... I mean if u dont  your job quit right and find another one.... They made my Egg Mcmuffin wrong and got mad becuz they had to make it again. No apology, no nothing.... They need new management in there for sure... Just horrible absolutely horrible....."}
{"text":"There are two extremes to this particular NEW McDonald's. Yes, I understand it is new, but there are certain attributes that time isn't going to fix. The positive is when I went for breakfast at approximately 4:30 am, after my shift from work, the man who was working was very polite. He used please, thank you and sir while speedily providing great service. He was awesome. BUT, there are two individuals that I cringe at the sound of their voice on the speaker phone for orders. These two particular individuals are rude and incredibly horrible with customer service. When I pull up to the first window to pay, they just stare at me until I hand them money. Not one word of addressing me as an individual or telling me the total or anything. So I pull forward after the first person hands my change back without saying a word. The next person, nearly throws the bag at me and doesn't even take the time to fold the top closed. There's no statement of address or any sort of communication whatsoever. This last time I went through to get breakfast and I was the only person in line. One of these same two people proceeded to take my order incorrectly and I had to correct it with a manager. I understand it's McDonald's, but there used to be a such thing as, \"Hello, may I take your order,\" \"Your total is 'x,' here is your change,\" or \"Thank you, sir, have a nice day.\" I will drive out of my way to avoid this one at all costs."}
{"text":"Bad service, slow service, rude employees. Come on McD's. 1st off they couldn't take two separate orders in drive thru, so had to go inside. Once inside my order which was a big breakfast and oatmeal took way to long to get. Then to top it off I ask if there was salsa I was told it was in bag. And it wasn't. Plus not fork. Get ur stuff together..."}

But a few co-workers and I had to attend an off-site meeting and on the way back to the office, we stopped here for lunch 'cos we were short on time.  We needed to grab something in a hurry.\n\nSo as far as McD's burgers go--ick!  Big Macs--double ick!  The milkshakes have always tasted like chalk as far as I'm concerned.  But I do like some of their salads and I gotta admit, their grilled chicken sandwiches are fairly palatable.  So one star for the salads and one star for the grilled chicken."}
{"text":"I am s regular customer for breakfast , today I ordered my usual breakfast sandwich and a large half and half sweet tea with a little bit of ice.

I sat in front of the door for 5 minutes until someone else came in and held the door for me.  When I called the \"manager\" Asha could not even understand what I was talking about and gave me the \"general manager\" Keisha.  I could hear her laughing as she passed the phone.  Keisha said she was sorry but handicapped people come in all the time.  They even have regulars that are handicapped.  When I asked how do they get in, she couldn't tell me just that they come in all the time.  \n\nWorse-when I was sitting in line, another employee came over to open a new line.  She sneezed loudly and conspicuously into her hands then yelled , \"Next!\"  and starting waiting on customers without washing her hands first."}

I did not go to the mgr as I was in a hurry.  Suffice it to say I will not patronize this McDonalds ever again.\n\nThis review is also going to McDonalds Corporate website."}
{"text":"Service is good, food was okay. Trashy people running around inside barking at employees. But, what do you expect from a McDonalds.."}
{"text":"Literally the most GHeTTo place I've ever come across. Disgusting, dirty, trashy, and rude ass employees! I've never gotten so much grief about ordering a damn side salad. Sorry you actually have to work instead of smacking your gum and throwing lettuce at each other. The girl told me \"be wit you in one second\", when she came back from filling her soda, she said \"oh shit, time for my break\" and literally walked away from an entire line of people. Nothing but incompetent, racist, employees. Racist to the girl when asked \"who's Coke is this for\" and she muttered \"that cracka over der\". Will never ever go back."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking. Of course I'm going to give it a 1 star rating just because it's McDonald's. On the contrary, I actually enjoy McDonald's food. Big Macs are horribly underrated, in my (unpopular) opinion.\n\nWith that being said, my rating is for this particular McDonald's location. It's a chaotic mess. The service is painfully slow, the employees are rude, and my orders have been messed up 95% of the time. I have waited 20 minutes for a coffee. A COFFEE! *facepalm*\n\nNeedless to say I will NEVER be returning. I'll pay a little extra to keep me from pulling my hair out of my head."}
{"text":"It's a McDonalds....if you don't know what a McDonald's is please return to your home planet....or at least do some research on ours.  \n\nDo not entertain this location if you are looking for fast service.  \n\nI'm writing this review on a single visit as I am unlikely to return to this particular franchise.  I was here on a Friday morning at 6:44 AM and the place was relatively slow for a downtown location, there was approximately 5 patrons ahead of me at the time.  I call that out to really highlight the next portion, during this visit I ordered 2 Egg White Delight sandwiches.  I then proceeded to wait for 14 minutes before they were ready, there were several other patrons also waiting for the same sandwich for a similar extended period.   \n\n     Whoever is managing the kitchen at this particular location has done a poor job.  It was clear that the runner at the front was doing her best to keep the anxiously waiting patrons happy as she stood there occasionally yelling the remaining items she was waiting on.  This woman deserved praise for her attempt to help keep the customers happy as her kitchen failed her.  \n\n     This is a McDonald's and therefore is reviewed as such, while I am not expecting 5 star dining, I am expecting a quick in and out experience, otherwise I would go to another establissme , especially with all the choices downtown."}
{"text":"Very dirty . Ordered a salsad to go. A fly came out of my salad \nDont eat there you will be very sick\nShame on you MAcdonald"}
{"text":"Nice and easy to get into this location from just about any direction - even if you are headed into town (though it does require an almost-u-turn).  Getting out is just about as simple, though you might have to deal with traffic on the way out, and that can be a bit of a headache.\n\nAs Stephen has mentioned, the food typically comes out quickly, and the staff at this location is generally nice as well - something you do not always find at all fast food places.\n\nOn a purely personal note, this McDonald's is responsible for our oldest son's first left turn at a stop light while driving (he made the turn without incident).  That is unlikely to influence your own decision, I just thought I would let you know."}
{"text":"For a \"fast\" food place.. this place is not that fast....  Yes, it's pretty convenient right on Independence on your way out to Matthews... but I rarely have eaten in the dining area and mostly base my experience with this McDonald's with the drive thru.\n\nThere is rarely a time that I don't drive by and see a line of at least 3 cars deep in the drive through.  Yes, it's a busy location, but even going through it... it seems like it should be a lot faster.\n\nMy roommate and I always joke and try to predict how long it will take to get thru the drive-thru based on the number of cars in line...  most of our estimates get in the range of going out to a sit-down place."}
{"text":"Even with a trainee at the register, the food was fast. Not much more to say about a run-of-the-mill McDonald's."}
{"text":"Still would not recommend this location. Ever. I wish management went through these reviews because this place needs some serious work."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve one star is a piece of crap all employees are rude as hell and they also never carry anything always out of something even the simplest thing like ranch . They pretend they have it wait in line for a long time and then you get to the window to be informed that they don't have that item and if you would like to change your order . Absolute ridiculous and shameful."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is an absolute mess. I ordered a meal with a coupon, and was told my total without the discount included! The manager was on the phone the whole time, the condiment area was horrifying, and two children were screaming at the top of their lungs. Get off the phone and straighten things up, manager!"}
{"text":"I get coffee here (sometimes). I haven't died (yet). It's a good start."}
{"text":"Itis COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE to be called SWEETIE by the person taking your drive through order.  It is also bad management to not replace your coffee machine before running out of iced coffee.   There's only a McDonald's everywhere."}
{"text":"Terrible place to go for dinner. The manager was rude, unprofessional, inconsiderate, and not nice. I can't believe McDonald's is hiring people like this man. I use my Mcdonald's App for a buy one get one free Sandwich. The manager had no clue how to use the bar code. He then said the scanner did not work. He had so much trouble putting in the code manually. He gave up and just said its not a valid code. The McDonald's app will not dis play an offer unless it is valid by date and barcode for special offers.  After clicking the in store use, seeing the code, not using it, the app automatically registered the coupon as being used. This manager made me waste my coupon and would not validate or compensate me for his mistake. Stop hiring incompetent people Mcdonald's. The place was also dirty and badly maintained."}
{"text":"Worst one I've been to poor service and everything broke or just don't have it need to close this place down edit BTW ordered filet o fish had to throw away bread was so stale I couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"THIS IS SO NASTY!! i only go for breakfast occasionally because it is on the way to work BUT they NEVER cook the english muffins enough its like they just pull them out of the bag and put cold meet n cheese on an uncooked muffin?! i only went back because i thought the first time was a fluke ... I WAS WRONG!! The workers are polite every time i go the food just SUCKS!"}
{"text":"It's a Mc Donalds in a theorhetically good location, but getting into the driveway is awkward. The food isn't exceptional in the realm of MCDs and the two speed mountains when leaving the drive through are minor foibles. But what bums me out is the fries. This location never seems to have (and/or give me) fresh fries. Its amazing how the degredation of a McDonalds french fry goes so quickly from delicious wonder,  to cake candle garbage in minutes. Meh."}
{"text":"Where to even begin...smh. Okay so I stopped at this McDonalds knowing that I just wanted something quick and cheap. I'm very aware that McDonalds is nothing special but, I didn't realize just how horrible my experience would be. So as I pulled up to the drive through the lady immediately told us to hold on, we didn't even get greeted. After we spent several minutes waiting for her to take our order she finally was ready. As we ordered, she failed to take down half of our order, which only consisted of a few items. We repeatedly had to say our order until she finally got it. Then after waiting for about ten min we got up to the first door to pay. The lady then proceeded to tell us our order and what do you know, IT WASN'T EVEN OUR ORDER! Then after we told her AGAIN our order she finally decided to input it into the system so we could pay. After paying, we waited about another 5 min before we then reached the second window for receiving our food. The first item we received was a soft served ice cream cone dipped in chocolate. Not only did the lady let the ice cream drip all over the cone before giving it to us but she also failed to let the dipped chocolate harden, which meant I basically was given a huge melted mess to the point where I had to throw the ice cream out because it wasn't even worth it. Then she gave us a large coke, or so we thought. My boyfriend tasted it and said it tasted horrible so he wanted a new one. The lady then told us that the coke machine was out of order so she had to give us Diet Coke instead. Um?!??? Aren't you supposed to at least let the customer know if you don't have an item on the menu before just deciding to give them a different option. So we asked for our money back which they gave us because frankly the other options weren't that great. The lady then said good bye and proceeded to close the door. We then had to tell her um hello?!? We have fries and a burrito as well! She then passed us our bag and we left. The burrito literally looked like it had been thrown together within 2 seconds and our fries we ordered were all over the bag and not even in the little cup that they are supposed to come in. Again I know I shouldn't expect much from a fast food place, let alone a McDonalds but really??? Never again is all I have to say."}
{"text":"Horrible service on this particular location. There was this girl there this past Sunday that was extremely rude and careless. I should have talked to a manager but I did not have time. She was rolling her eyes and seemed really unhappy to be working there. I mean, I guess what do I expect from McDonalds!"}
{"text":"Nothing much different about this McDonald's than the rest.. But if you are in a rush this drive thru is not the stop you should make . I stop here multiple times weekly and make sure I have ample time even if two cars are in front of me it's not very speedy ."}
{"text":"Brenda made my day! I was more asleep than awake & heard hazelnut caramel (when it was hazelnut or caramel) but decided on hazelnut. Brenda totally made hazelnut caramel happen!!! Usually i have the worst experiences at mcdonald's. Not this time! Thanks Brenda!!!"}
{"text":"This is the most disgusting McDonald's I've ever been to. I live by campus so it's easy for me to come to this location (store #21201). I ordered seven things and all seven things came out wrong or completely burnt like a brick. I'm a nice person and they were treating me like they prepared my food like this on purpose. They didn't even apologize when I ask why they did this. The drive thru took me 30 minutes and it took me another 15 minutes to go back and get my refund. The manager was the one who took my order and she was by far the meanest and grumpiest person I've ever seen. Her only response was she was busy but there was only 5 people in the restaurant total. The people who work here are lack charisma, are spiteful and on top of that they do not clean the restaurant at all. After seeing how filthy the dining area is I can't even imagine what their kitchen must look like."}
{"text":"This place gets a negative zero! But had to give a one star to post!  Horrible service. 3 ladies working totally ignored me. I waited close to 10 minutes and I was the only customer in the store. I was being ignored so I left. Never will I ever step foot in this horrible Mc Donald's again. Maryland pkwy & Tropicana 11/20/16"}
{"text":"I gave it 1 star for their service. I was there around 6 a.m. and not very busy at all. I ordered 2 breakfast sandwiches at the intercom and by the time I got to the window I decided I wanted to add drinks as well. The guy at the window gave off an attitude and said for future reference place your complete order back there. I said I'm sorry, I didn't want drinks originally but decided on it when I got to the window, besides I'm paying for them. He repeated himself again, for future reference place your order back there. What would you do? Would you have stuck around? 'Cuz I didn't. Good thing I didn't give him my money. I wonder what the owner would think if he knew he lost a sale and maybe more since I'm telling you?"}
{"text":"It's McDonalds, not a class establishment to begin with. This one was a little dirty and not efficient with it's service. Waited a very long time for food during a not so busy time."}
{"text":"The longest wait time ever!!! Dirty dirty place. Service is horrible!! I've been to a lot of drive thrus but this OMG. 20 min wait time and I was at the freaking window already!"}
{"text":"The manager during the shift this morning seemed rather rude to one of his employees, an older man who looked like he was still learning, and the manager had little to no patience, constantly snapped at him and was also rushing ME to the point where I felt uncomfortable even asking for ketchup. And I was only given ONE napkin inside my utensil packet. Only came here because it's right beside the school, otherwise, I'd have gone elsewhere."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Wouldn't refund my money after I ordered two SAUSAGE and EGG McMuffin..... When my associates opened their food there was ONLY bread.... No CHEESE, no SAUSAGE, no EGG."}
{"text":"It's kind of crazy because I've never thought I'd be writing a review for a McDonald's but let me tell you, I'm so shocked by the quality of the filet-o-fish and the quarter pounder deluxe we got. Both sandwiches look like they came out of a commercial. You can just tell the workers really took their time to prepare it.\n\nNot only was their food at a good quality, but the girl that was working the register was super sweet. McDonalds probably don't get that many reviews because they don't have much high expectations. But this McDonalds stood out to me."}
{"text":"Came back to check if problem of ordering medium meal and asking for large drink was resolved. To my surprise after complaining 2 times I was still refused the large drink with my medium meal. I had to show the shift manager an email the store owner sent me so I could get my drink large. I also followed up with the store manager by phone to inform him of this problem. Hopefully next time this problem will be resolved. On the plus side the restaurant is cleaner."}
{"text":"Nic quick service. The food is very good as usual and management very nice. The McChicken sandwich seem to be extra crispy over here. And it's very close to the Vons grocery store. Just a perfect spot to grab something to eat quick and very cheap as usual."}
{"text":"Some tourist/UNLV price inflation here - expect some items to be 25-30 cents above normal and they don't do the $1 any size sodas and coffee. Go a few blocks down Tropicana to the one just past McLeod / the Walmart for regular pricing (and a way nicer dining room).\n\nAll the stank-ass Maryland homebums congregate here in the morning, even though there are hella other fast food places open early right nearby they all bomb this place up for some reason. So it smells and all the seats are jammed up from opening to whenever the nearest kitchen starts serving lunch I guess.\n\nNot surprisingly given the clientele you can also expect the men's room to be trashed and something really funky going on with the toilet if you need to stop in."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE was trapped in the drive though for 20 min!!!!!!!! They could warn people of the wait!!! Unbelievable- employees are rude and have a bad attitude DO NOT COME HERE"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for the fries ! Yum ! Plus use their app and you'll get great deals and sometimes free items."}
{"text":"This McDonald's has been the worst so far in my life . The service is horrible literally waited 15min at drive thru ...  I though drive thru meant fast !!"}
{"text":"I asked for a chocolate chip frappe and a spicy chicken. I got a powerade and my spicy chicken was just the meat and buns. The only reason I give 2 stars is cause the lady at the drive thru was very nice."}
{"text":"Ordered at the drive through, heard the lady take my order correctly and even say out loud to the food preparers the order. Got my order and it was incorrect. Went inside and asked for my order to be fixed. As I waited there was a guy standing next to me also waiting for an order to be fixed. He got his and walked away shaking his head. I then heard the cashier tell the manager, \"man, customers today...\" That's when I then decided to say i just wanted my money back. Very unprofessional. As I walked away from it all I realized he didn't even give me the correct change back. He shorted me $0.65. Never going back and will be calling the higher ups."}
{"text":"This location is close to the local University and has sliding glass entrance doors. This is a highly frequented location, but for some reason it doesn't get the location service love.\n\nIt has WiFi and would be a good spot to get some email finished or to watch a few videos. There isn't a lot of seats but the drink refill station is central."}
{"text":"While waiting for my car to be cleaned next door, I decided I needed some breakfast.  The line was short, only 1 patron ahead of me. But what I walked into was total filth.\n\nThe trash was over flowing at 10:15 am. The tables and floors were littered with trash and spilt food and coffee. The staff were working hard and trying to have a good attitude bit who could working in a filthy restaurant.  This is the second time finding this place like this, which means the Franchise or owner does not care.  It is a shame that McDonald's allows this to tarnish a otherwise decent dining experience in most McDonald's.  Think twice before going to this location."}
{"text":"Idiots! I was in the drive thru for about 15 minutes only to get a mcchicken add pickles. When I finally get it, it I a mcchicken no mayo with like bbq sauce or something! I ate it because I was starving and pregnant and running late. When I call them no-one even answers the phone!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was a terrible experience in every possible way. The wait time in the drive thru lane was excessive, the order was incorrect, and the chicken was slimy and smelled like it was rotting. I haven't eaten McDonald in over a year before trying it again and I found it to be just as disgusting as the last time."}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's I've ever been to. Third time coming here, out of various items every time, unbelievably slow, and staff is not welcoming at all. I would also give a zero if I could."}
{"text":"Maybe they could tell the homeless man sleeping in the booth for the last hour to leave."}
{"text":"I only come here to get their 99 cent bags of ice that are advertised all over their outside windows. \n\nUnfortunately, out of 6 visits they have only had the bagged ice once. Why??? And offering me a large cup of ice for the same price is not gonna make me happy Mr. Manager. Just bag that ice up...."}
{"text":"Seriously my frappe was chocolate water disgusting!\nHow hard is it to make a blended drink?\nSorry but frappes are like my crack so don't mess that up."}
{"text":"2nd time at this new location and again they have no ice cream products due to machine being down. Worst part is that you are then stuck in the line trying to get out of the drive thru. Total waste of time. Visit another location."}
{"text":"Sketchy Clientele = Check\nTypical Locked Restroom Access = Check\nHomeless Scattered Throughout the Parking Lot = Check"}
{"text":"They are always screwing up my order and sometimes the food is sloppy. But, the people are usually nice. I guess that's a plus."}
{"text":"Slowest DRIVE THRU ever!!!! Also the quintessential SHORT BUS Location.\n\nI frequented this location around dinner time since it is the closest to my home a few times and every time it is between a 10-15 min ordeal. When i worked at Mickey D's in the early 90's we had what was called 90 sec HBO( Hand Bag Out), from order to picking up should be no longer than 90 secs. This must not be a practiced any longer.  I have to say hello when I drive up to the speaker due to getting no response. Then I get someone who is rude and say's yes. I order the big mac deal, buy 1, get 1 for a $1. The employee says they do not offer that, I advise their menu out front does. After 5 min of silence and cars backing up I pull fwd to make sure he is still living to see what is up. Total lack of cust serv service, he had to have the mgr show him how to ring it up, no apology or anything. This happened each time I went there. C'mon man"}
{"text":"They almost NEVER have mcflurries. It's always \"we're out of icecream\". Really? At 1pm on a Tuesday afternoon? I've tried multiple times and they just never have it. They also quite frequently mess up our orders. Staff doesn't seem to care. Rude! I wish it were better because I live around the corner. After not having mcflurries again yesterday AND messing up our order we wont be eating here anymore. Sonic down the street from now on."}
{"text":"McDonalds is an American fast food restaurant which is slowly gaining popularity in the Phoenix Metro area.  They serve hamburgers, french fries ... ok just kidding ... \n\nThis is the McDonald's right by my house (btw, is Yelp! safe?) ... and the reason why it's being reviewed is because at lunch time the drive-thru is SUPER SPEEDY!  \n\nI drive by three McDonald's to get here and they all have ENORMOUS lines, but not this one!\n\nBig UPS!"}
{"text":"I only went because I had a coupon for a free Bacon Clubhouse Burger which was as expected... blah.  With all the wonderful Non Fast Food places to get a burger these days (at a fairly competitive price) why ever choose fast fast food?  Really?  Why?\n\nI haven't been to McDonald's in about 5 or 6 years and no reason to ever go again."}
{"text":"My husband, son and I went to this location on E Mcdowell Rd for lunch today. This particular location gets a lot of business. It is relatively new as the previous building was torn down and a new one was built on the same site and opened in 2015. \nThere were homeless people that were hanging out when we visited today. We gave them some food and some Monopoly Pieces we peeled off of our food that were winners for free french fries and a quarter pounder with cheese. \nThe manager on duty was very friendly, efficient, and fast in waiting on the customers. All of the crew members worked together to prepare the meals and get the orders out including in the drive-thru. \nWhen we are in the area again, I would not hesitate to stop by. This is a good location."}
{"text":"Don't even bother coming here. This was supposed to be the future of McDonald's. Kiosks where you could order your food and not interact with people. But unfortunately that did not happen. The people behind the counter looks like they shouldn't even be here and They don't want to be here. Why the hell are they getting paid $15 an hour? But the new building is nice but that's not a good enough reason to come and actually get food."}
{"text":"they don't serve burgers after 330am due to the new 24 hour breakfast. management must be a little \"slow\" on the uptake to not be able to serve breakfast and burgers at the same time. might be the dumbest move financially."}
{"text":"Gonna wait next time a mcflurry craving hits... My mcflurry looked like there was only one Oreo mixed in and half of it was outside the cup. \n\nGot hounded for change coming and going, then a fight broke out in the Parking lot as we were leaving. Gotta remember not to return here ever! Yeesh! :-/"}
{"text":"Bad service. They were slow to give my order even though they were only a few customers that time. Also I spotted a few homeless guys just outside sitting. Not only that, the place isn't all that neat. Find a spots of dirt on the floor. If it weren't a request of my niece then I wouldn't have gone here."}
{"text":"This place is super ghetto. \nTeens pretty much take it ocer from 7 am to 9am and then all afternoon. \nAnd if it is not the teens then it is the homeless begging for food or money!\nHowever the bright spot is this smoking hot young mexican woman named Kim.\nTotally a little cutie!"}
{"text":"I would literally give this Mcdonald's zero stars if I could, I work 1/2 mile away and sometimes when I need coffee and don't want to go into Starbucks because it is too busy I decide to go here. I ALWAYS REGRET IT. I just got an iced coffee and they do this to me every time and i shouldn't be shocked anymore, but I order an iced coffee and say \" can I have less than half of the cream and sugar you add\" they usually get confused, so i rephrase and say \" can I have a light iced coffee\" they know what it means because it is on the sticker on my cup right now... and my coffee is literally white... so now it is going in the trash and I just wasted $2. I don't need diabetes in a cup, but thanks anyways McDonald's."}
{"text":"Bag was stolen by a store employee while I sat and listened to my iPad eating lunch. Caught on video, store manager and owner covering up the situation.

{"text":"This is the short bus of all McDonald's.\n\nUnfortunately after the economy bit it McD's decided they really didn't want most of the stores open 24 hours everyday and just left a couple of them in the Valley.  This is the one closest to my work but its not like the store locator on their website tells you that.\n\nOne, there are ferociously long lines after bar close.  Hint, you might want to leave another location to the east and North open to help.  Like the one on Camelback or Indian School.  \n\nTwo, if I come at say 3:45am I never know if they are serving breakfast or lunch at this location.  The schedule seems to be determined by how things are progressing in the lunar cycle.  Crack in the Box has figured out how to both simultaneously, why can't McDonald's?\n\nThree, they can't figure out how to clean their shake machine one side at a time or change when they clean it based on business volume or say overnight temps.  My thought is that if it is not going to go under 100 overnight they should maybe leave it on and clean it 7am.  If I am at loose ends at 3:45 am I may want a shake if its hot out, eh?\n\nFour, and this is the worst.  I have actually been sitting in line to pick up my food after ordering and listened to the window person chat about the morning news with the vehicle ahead of me.  This has happened more than once!

I asked to speak to a manager and he said he can make them for me but it would take 10 minutes. I said I could wait. I waited 15 minutes before I had to leave my car and walk in to see what was taking so long. I asked for the managers managers phone number but was told he cannot give that type of info out and I would have to call tomorrow. \n\nWorst customer service skills ever this manger had. No sympathy...he just wanted me out of his sight..."}
{"text":"They are really slow and the teenagers there don't care about their jobs. This is the worse McDonald's I've ever been to. I recommend Litchfield road and McDowell or Dysart rd south of the i-10. Who ever does the hiring here needs to hire more adults."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, parking was difficult because they have a terrible traffic flow system. Once inside, the girl behind the counter was clueless, the register didn't work and had to be rebooted, their ice machine had absolutely NO ice and then I had to wait more than 10 minutes to get my food (even though there was no line). Once I got my food, it was cold (even the French fries were cold and extremely chewie-gross!). Not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"Definately not service with a smile. Order is usually wrong, and workers are rude."}
{"text":"Food is fine, as to be expected from this burger shop. ... problem is the customer service.  My visit to this McDonald's gave me enough incentive to not only download the Yelp app, but also create an account.   Our register aficionado, Antonio, seemed to only know two phrases \"here or to go? \" and \"here is your cups\".  Any  other time during the multiple order transaction was spent either sucking on his finger,  staring blankly at the cash register,  or scowling at my wife or me, as if we were an inconvenience to him."}
{"text":"Now I see why people say awful things about this location and the staff. The customer service is appalling and the staff truly don't care the least bit,.. Nor does the management. \nI'm not a huge fan of McDonald's anyways but on my way home from a long day at the base taking care of paperwork since my husband passed away. I decided to stop through the drive-through with my daughter and pick up some french fries and a drink for myself. Additionally since my daughter was so good while I was taking care of my errand I decided to treat her to an Oreo McFlurry. \nAbsolutely everything was wrong after I had placed my order! I pulled up to the first window and paid for the fries, flurry and drink.\nAs usual the french fries we were absolutely disgusting and not fresh! Instead of a Dr Pepper like I had ordered I received a diet something. Grrr...! Then the worst part of all was the Mc flurry. Which they never told me that her make flurry shake thing was down and not operable. Instead they just let me pay then go to the next window and handed me the Mc Flurry like everything was just peachy keen. But before I handed it to my daughter I looked at it and the layer of cookies had not at all! After I noticed that I had asked them if it had been mixed since the spoon was different and judging by the thick layer of cookie it appeared not. It was then that I was finally informed that they had apparently ran out of the spoons that make the McFlurries. Apparently they ran out of the spoons to do the mixing so they decided to put cookie mix on the bottom and the top and I was to do the mixing myself. I don't know about you but seems a bit backwards. So after I was told that I needed to do the mixing I asked for a separate cup in spoon so that way I could have a spoon for when the one that they gave me breaks from mixing as well is it, so it doesn't get messy. They give me the smallest spoon and the largest cup possible. I would've simply settled for the same size that you gave me the first time and the bigger size of make flurry the snack size cup. But I'm sure it was a direct way to aggravate me since I had asked for the information on where I provide feedback.\nThe problem is very simple to understand they have no concern for losing their job or the location being closed simply because of where they are located which is right outside of the military base so their customers will come to them constantly. It's really a shame."}
{"text":"What a pleasant experience ordering my 2 for 3.33 special store had no problems putting on. A folded egg and no cheese. I asked if it was a problem the cashier said no problem we do it all the time. I asked if this store was owned by the same people as the the anthem store she said yes . i explained they wouldnt put folded eggs on and i got charged full price on both at the anthem location. She was shocked. Place has a great staff and is clean."}
{"text":"I took my children in one morning because they wanted to visit their play-land.  They do have a awesome play- land for kids. I was disappointed when I had ordered some chicken nuggets during breakfast hours for my kids and their manager refused to make them.  I have worked for this company in the past and their policy is to make fried products all day.  When I questioned it the manager said \" It's not our policy\".  She had no name tag on of course, but was a heavy older women that was just plain rude.  This is a corporate store, there are several other McDonald's in the area that are more friendly."}
{"text":"My double cheeseburger only had one patty so I called and Camille was so helpful. She offered another one for free on my next visit and was really professional about the situation."}
{"text":"Do not bother going to this McDonald's, wasting your time waiting for food that has been sitting in the counter for 10 mins. The manager didn't even give a shit. A gentleman in line said they always mess up your order here, but he continues to go to this one due to being down the street from his house. I feel like the employees do not care or show any sort of pride in their work which they're learning from their manager. This McDonald's doesn't even deserve 1/2 star."}
{"text":"This place..I almost caught full blown AIDS from the condiment station. What happen here? Refugees come through here?"}
{"text":"There was a rude cashier always on her phone she was laughing so hard and obnoxiously to coworkers."}
{"text":"One star because you can't get any lower. They are always slow and 9 times out of 10 their ice cream machine is broken. You get stuck in line just trying to get a cone when ever other McDonald's has one that works.  Never going there again, I will drive the extra 5 minutes to Garden Lakes because at least when you go there, your service is reliable and you have a clue of what you are getting."}
{"text":"Don't you just HATE it when you are pulling into a McDonald's with an empty drive-thru and then suddenly 3 or 4 cars pull up out of no where in front of you???\n\nThis one is pretty quick to handle a mass of hungry drivers seeking another McMeal in the drive-thru lane.\n\nBesides, being pretty quick, the other thing I do like about McDonald's is that they are consistent, no surprises here.\n\n I like that I can get a $1 coffee anytime of the day too (nothing like the smell of McDonald's breakfast permeating from the Drive-thru window of the Golden Arches in the morning)....mmmm!"}
{"text":"McDonald's sucks! Only reason to eat here is cheap and if your in a hurry. Their is so many other options to go for do it! Otherwise you will regret eating this garbage!"}
{"text":"They can't get one order right. I always get the wrong food. I ordered a Big mac combo meal and received 10 pieces of nasty chicken nuggets even after she repeated my order while she handed it to me. Avoid this place. Wendy's is much better."}
{"text":"I moved to the area a year ago.  I've been to this McDonalds drive up a few times.  Maybe it's just bad luck, but these guys have never got the order right and half the time I have to park and wait.  Can't even call the management to complain, no answer.  I have an answer for them.  You're out of chances. I will drive out of my way to find another McDonalds that has their act together."}
{"text":"Stay FAR away from this establishment! Customer service is out the window and definitely making me never want to go to mcdonalds..."}
{"text":"Crappy service. The lady taking my money at the first window didn't count my money properly and said I was missing $2 after I recounted my money several times, she apologized and smiled in a smirk, when she finally recounted it, that is why you work at McDonald's smdh. The drive through line is horrible when busy! It blocks the way of traffic through the complex. Most of all when I ordered fries, I asked for no salt so they can drop in a new batch knowing how filthy it is inside I couldn't trust regular fries sitting out. As I got my fries I asked for 2 large I looked in the bag when I got home and it was 2 small as it looked like the large fries box were less than halfway filled up. Smh never going here again."}
{"text":"The dining area is really small!  I still put this McD's better than the one in Buckeye.  We actually had a pretty nice experience dining in.  The cashier was really nice."}

{"text":"I absolutely HATE this McDonalds. It has the most incompetent, slow employees EVER! Almost every time I go there to get a $1 soda, and iced coffee, or something to eat with my kids, it is an agonizing process whether in the drive thru or in the restaurant. I try to avoid this location even though it is 2 blocks from my house. This location has been this way for at least 2 years.....no hope for it changing any time soon..."}
{"text":"This is by far the slowest McDonalds I have ever been to. We went through the drive thru and the line wasn't long but we ended up spending over 15 minutes waiting. We had a very small order and they managed to take over 5 minutes from the time I pulled up to the window to the time they handed me my food. I will never come to this location again."}

Thank you so much Gustavo, and the (2) attendants you made my daughters b-day party a very special day for her and all of her family that came!!!!! I love this McDoanlds!!"}

{"text":"I moved to this area in 2003 and have been coming here ever since. There have been some times that the crew wasn't at their sharpest, and one period of about a year when there was a language barrier (I always had to check before I drove off to see if my Diet Coke was really a Dr. Pepper), but overall, it's been very good. And ALWAYS very, very clean, which is what I *really* want in a restaurant. \n\nThe food is typical McDonalds. I've never had a cold or stale sandwich or fries, and whenever there's something wrong, it's always fixed quickly. \n\nNow, as for \"quickly\" .. please consider that people can only move and food can only cook so fast. I usually go during breakfast & lunch, and while it's very busy, they usually have a full kitchen. There are only one or two cashiers, but if you pile up too many orders, there's more of a chance to get it wrong. \n\nSaturdays are CRAZY busy, I try not to go then! Sometimes I really, really need a Filet 'O Fish, but I know what it'll be like, so I'm not surprised if I'm waiting forever. \n\nAnd Shane M ... is it really fair to rate this one McDs so low when you get sick at ALL of them? I've noticed that on other restaurants I've reviewed, too; food allergies are a real problem these days, perhaps it's not \"karma\". \n\nAnyway, if you like McDonald's, it's a good one, but busy. They do great birthday parties, and the people are very nice. If you don't like McDonald's, there's an awesome KFC right there!"}
{"text":"i went to this McDonald on a summer friday night, they were messing peoples orders, taking way to long, and skipping orders. I ordered a Spicy Chicken to go, and they didn't put patty. It became a Vegetarian burger...and thats not mentioning how they forgot to put at least Buffalo Sauce in the \"burger\".  Place looks pretty nice tho"}
{"text":"Avoid the drive thru.!!!! They never get the order right. \n\nHere is a list of other problems.\n-they serve expired food ..pies with date stamps from 2days earlier.\n-tables are rarely clean\n-drinks are watery\n-employees are not friendly\n-managers don't care and seem to even encourage poor servce.\n\n...i could go on and on, but why waste my time with these fools."}
{"text":"Came through the drive through to order ice cream and the machine is down. I understood. I looked at the menu to see what other desserts I can order since I drove here. I ordered two Apple pies and the girl who is taking my order says there are no Apple pies because someone just ordered some. I asked to speak to a manager and he said he can make them for me but it would take 10 minutes. I said I could wait. I waited 15 minutes before I had to leave my car and walk in to see what was taking so long. I asked for the managers managers phone number but was told he cannot give that type of info out and I would have to call tomorrow. \n\nWorst customer service skills ever this manger had. No sympathy...he just wanted me out of his sight..."}
{"text":"They are really slow and the teenagers there don't care about their jobs. This is the worse McDonald's I've ever been to. I recommend Litchfield road and McDowell or Dysart rd south of the i-10. Who ever does the hiring here needs to hire more adults."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, parking was difficult because they have a terrible traffic flow system. Once inside, the girl behind the counter was clueless, the register didn't work and had to be rebooted, their ice machine had absolutely NO ice and then I had to wait more than 10 minutes to get my food (even though there was no line). Once I got my food, it was cold (even the French fries were cold and extremely chewie-gross!). Not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"Definately not service with a smile. Order is usually wrong, and workers are rude."}
{"text":"Food is fine, as to be expected from this burger shop. ... problem is the customer service.  My visit to this McDonald's gave me enough incentive to not only download the Yelp app, but also create an account.   Our register aficionado, Antonio, seemed to only know two phrases \"here or to go? \" and \"here is your cups\".  Any  other time during the multiple order transaction was spent either sucking on his finger,  staring blankly at the cash register,  or scowling at my wife or me, as if we were an inconvenience to him."}
{"text":"Now I see why people say awful things about this location and the staff. The customer service is appalling and the staff truly don't care the least bit,.. Nor does the management. \nI'm not a huge fan of McDonald's anyways but on my way home from a long day at the base taking care of paperwork since my husband passed away. I decided to stop through the drive-through with my daughter and pick up some french fries and a drink for myself. Additionally since my daughter was so good while I was taking care of my errand I decided to treat her to an Oreo McFlurry. \nAbsolutely everything was wrong after I had placed my order! I pulled up to the first window and paid for the fries, flurry and drink.\nAs usual the french fries we were absolutely disgusting and not fresh! Instead of a Dr Pepper like I had ordered I received a diet something. Grrr...! Then the worst part of all was the Mc flurry. Which they never told me that her make flurry shake thing was down and not operable. Instead they just let me pay then go to the next window and handed me the Mc Flurry like everything was just peachy keen. But before I handed it to my daughter I looked at it and the layer of cookies had not at all!

Come here every morning before I take my daughter to drop her off at the babysitters we order a hot latte any apple cranberry oatmeal Faithfully at least 3 times a week. Today I was going to treat all 3 of my kids since I'm off and it's really cold outside so I hit the drive-thru and we order three peppermint hot cocoa and a large hot latte. We order our Beverages and sit in the drive thru for about 8 minutes then we approached the window and the lady asked us to pull forward and wait for our drinks. I asked well how long is that going to be she says about another 4 minutes. Okay so I've already been sitting in the drive thru for about 8 minutes before approaching the window for pickup now I have to park for just 4 drinks.  so I send my oldest son in to cancel the order because now we're going to be late for school. If he's in there one of the employees come out with the drinks and says oh is that your son in there and said yes it is I sent him in there to cancel the order we're now going to be late to school. Now my son comes out and he tells me Mom I tried to cancel the order and the lady wouldn't let me she couldn't speak good English but she kept yelling at me telling me you have to have the drinks bring me the drinks and I'll cancel your order my son repeatedly tells her we don't have the drinks were waiting at the drive-thru pick up window this is taking too long and I don't want to be late to school can I please cancel the order. She again repeatedly continues to yell at my son and tell him know bring me the drinks.  had I have known this before I pulled off taking my kids to school I would have went in and dealt with her I've now tried calling the store repeatedly and no one answers the phone.  I will continue to call and find out who she was my son tells me that she was a little short Mexican woman with painted-on eyebrows lol"}

Tonite is different though, I actually called to complain this time. Much to my surprise the girl started an argument with me over the phone and accused me of lying about it! She \"remembers the order\" \"knows the food is in the bag\" etc... that's a pretty shi**y way to treat a customer. She may have put the food in a bag, but it wasn't my in my bag!"}
{"text":"Stopped by McDonald's tonight to take advantage of their pick 2 which at two bucks was a great deal. It was also a big part of their turn around. The bait and switch has returned to the arches. The pick 2 is now five dollars on items that I don't want. These guys again try to slip this to us hoping we won't notice.\nBurger King, right next door had a nice two items for 3 bucks. The fries were better and there was more of them."}
{"text":"Clean play yard, fast fresh food. Everything is nice and new and clean. Let's hope it stays that way. The fountain drinks aren't watered down like at most fast food places. I like to ask for unsalted fries later in the day to make sure I get fresh ones."}
{"text":"We frequent this McDonalds often because when our grandkids  come over, they always want the McNuggets. Well,  my husband just  drove over for an order in this extensive heat, and get gets back home, and one of the sirloin burgers we ordered  had a bun, lettuce, onion and cheese. NO BURGER PATTY! So he leaves all the other food here at home and now has to make another return trip -to return the screw up. Then when my husband (who has been there twice now), gets home-  he gets to eat food cold French fries and a cold sirloin burger (he had left the other part of the order home when we discovered the missing hamburger patty.)  Nice. McDonald's....... at  least have your employees check the food, before wrapping it up.  Sheesh!"}
{"text":"With the lunch satchel empty, and in need of cheap calories to get me home after working and running errands, I pulled in to the split drive-thru looking for sustenance.  For the most part..you can find this at any McD's, and this location is no exception.\n\nAs previously stated, I rolled into the split drive-thru and ordered up a jalape√±o burger combo.  Nice enough on the squawk box.  Rolled in and paid.  Bounced to the instructed window and found a very nice worker.  Out I went on to Cheyenne.\n\nThis location is a model of efficiency.  Short was the time between purchase and consumption.  Long were the tears as I hated myself while I devoured the meal heading west into the sunset."}
{"text":"Finally a playland that doesn't make me cringe at the thought of my kids playing in it. Although it is very small. Perfect for the mid-day play time with the younger kids but I couldn't see more than 4 small children playing in it at the same time. Another perk- tall ceilings. If you have a small child you know that at least once per visit you will find yourself climbing through worm holes to find your screaming toddler. Not this one! I was able to stand upright and walk all the way to the top of the tallest tower to rescue my prince in distress!! All around I think it's a great playland. Let's just hope they keep up the appearance and cleanliness."}

{"text":"This McDonald's looks super snazzy... It's one of those new ones with the double drive thru windows which has to come in handy at some point... Luckily, it wasn't too busy when we came through...  \n\nHonestly, McDonald's visits are mostly hit or miss for me...  Usually one item is hot, the other is lukewarm or sometimes even cold... Ugh.  This one was a hit... The nuggets* I ordered were nice and crispy... The fries were piping hot and not overly salted... The Happy Meal toy was a hit with my friend's kid, so there's that...  \n\n*Yeah, I know the \"nuggets\" are mechanically separated chicken like parts, but sometimes I like that sort of thing...  It just takes me back to days when I didn't have to pay bills and my only concern was making sure my toy was the one I wanted."}
{"text":"Ok so I have to retire from going out to lunch at this McD's, what a joke. I have given them many many chances and it just seems they will never get it right. If you want to wait and have alot of time to waste this is the place for you. How do I order something as simple as a plain McChicken meaning no mayo or lettuce just the darn chicken and bun and people after me ordering burgers that need assembly and even McChickens with lettuce and mayo get served before me I am talking 3 people behind me one person with an $11 order. They just cannot handle the lunch crowd this happens everytime and I am not exagerating. I just don't get it. It is almost like you have to except poor service when going here as that is the cost of being able to have a McD's in this area. Also why is only 1 person working the counter? I have literally walked in and turned right around when I see 15 people in line and one person taking orders. Hire another person or pull someone off the drive-thru. This place is just a failure everytime but the turnover is so great that losing 25 customers a day doesn't put a dent in their finances I guess. Poor service, slow service, cannot handle multiple people in line, kinda of dirty and just a hassle 99% of the time. I am done with it , brown bag it and save $ and gas while I am at it. This is just a sign of the times bad service and nothing done about it. If any worker there claims they deserve $15 an hour come sit next to me at work and watch how I handle the workload of 3 people everyday while providing great service. Not much is asked of these employees and they still can't handle it."}
{"text":"Service here is so poor. It's in a very high traffic area and is very busy for that reason alone. I pulled in this AM and was the only car waiting to order, while I sat there a car pulled into the other order lane. Employee came over the speaker with their opening, \"would you like to order (insert menu item here) today?\". I respond, \"no thank you.\" Silence.......... then I hear her help the other lane. She comes back to me and asks what I want, I give her the breakfast menu item #, more silence........... then I hear her help the other lane again. I can see the initial entry of what I ordered on my screen so I know she heard me, never asked what I wanted to drink, never gave me a total, asked me to pull forward, nothing. I left.\nDrove 2 exits South to the Chick-fil-A where I was quickly acknowledged and helped, with a smile, with better quality food and my order wasn't practically thrown out the drive thru window into my car.\nSave yourself the aggravation and just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is a new McDonald's with the new restaurant design.   When I arrived for lunch the parking lot was full but we lucked out in getting a parking place right away.\n\nThe restaurant is decorated very nice for a fast food place.  It doesn't look like your typical McDonald's.  \n\nOrdering was typical for a fast food place.  But this place was giving out free samples of strawberry lemonade and one of their coffee drinks.  Nice touch.  The strawberry lemonade was actually very good.\n\nThe food is typical of a McD's - oversalted fries and burgers that America loves.\n\nThis is also a good stopping place before or after a visit to Carowinds.  It seems Carowinds employees come here also as we saw two of them here.  My burger and fries cost me $2.81 at McD's.  It would have cost 3 times that at the park."}
{"text":"Very nice, newer McDonalds. Fast service, easy access, even if the moron customers don't know how to drive in the parking lot LOL."}
{"text":"This MCDS screws up my order 95% of the time. Sometimes the food is wrong, sometimes they dont give me my whole order, but it happens majority of the times ive been..unfortunatly its cheap, fast and right around the corner...check your food before you leave. and if you get a smile while your there you must be special."}
{"text":"I think more folks should review fast food because not all locations are equal.  This location could go down in history as worst location ever for McDonald's.  Employees yelling at each other, filthy,  you have to ask for everything..they charge for sauce and keep the salt behind the counter.  Food was cold and still had to ask for ketchup.  So if you are traveling through Ohio, please think twice before you stop at this one."}
{"text":"I'll make it simple and sweet. WORST McDonalds ever. Terrible service, flies everywhere, long wait time, and completely incorrect order."}
{"text":"Slowest McDonald's I've ever been to. There were only 3 people working on a Sunday morning. They should have realized that many people are traveling on a holiday weekend. I normally wouldn't write a review but I have so much time between placing my order and waiting for it to be done that I thought I would. It's been about 15 minutes and I still have 6 people waiting in front of me. \n\nAdditionally, after we left the travel plaza, we found that they didn't even get an order right! \n\nIf u are traveling on I80 I would highly suggest eating at the travel plazas before or after. We noticed a ton of places to pull off about 15 minutes east of that plaza."}
{"text":"Worst McDonalds on OH. The customer service was so slow. The employees were not friendly at all. I saw almost every customer going back to get an item that was forgotten. \nOn a good note the travel plaza was very nice. Very large with lots of space. I also won $100 on a scratch ticket!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Stingiest McDonald I have ever been. You have to beg for ketchup and napkins.  The staff here are not friendly at all.  They don't even know how to fake a smile."}

{"text":"It is difficult to get to the drive thru and the parking  lot was  congested. The line was short and the staff was friendly . However  we had to wait for their nuggets. There is only one spot to wait but there were three cars waiting. The person delivering was all confused.  He dropped off the meal then tried to take it out of my car . The fries were cold and hard."}
{"text":"Let's start with, its McDonalds.  Went this morning and the driver thru was quick and the people were friendly.  As always, the food was good for McDonalds.  Let's remember...it is called fast food for a reason."}
{"text":"This, ladies and gentlemen, is what fast food is supposed to be like. Unhealthy but prompt : )\nStopped here for breakfast on our way to the zoo (volunteering and almost late). We decided to go inside but order to go. 2 minutes, tops.\n\nHubby got his drink, we stopped back by the counter, I made a comment about the bad idea for the McCrap name (McWrap), and done was our food. We got it and left.\n\nFast, easy, good parking, friendly service."}
{"text":"Service was fast.  The food was freshly prepared. I was happy with the cleanliness.  Monica, the counter person was exceedingly helpful."}
{"text":"Here's my simple order for the drive through at this location.  4 hamburgers - 2 plain, 2 regular.  Here's what I got - 2 plain, two buns with cheese, mustard and ketchup.  No burger at all in the last two and way off what I originally ordered.  And, since it was a drive through order, we were well on our way to my daughter's appointment when we discovered the error.  Not enough time to turn around and go back (and honestly, waiting in the drive through line for another 10 minutes along with the time to return just wasn't going to fit in our schedules).  So, I called the restaurant, explained what happened and asked if they could just credit my credit card for the amount of the purchase.  First off, no apology for being so off on the order, and secondly, the woman said we had to return the food to prove they had made a mistake.  When I offered that we ordered at the drive through because we were on our way to an appointment and didn't have time to return to show them I wasn't making my story up, she said they needed the food to give any refund.  What a racket!  As long as they throw something in the bag, in their minds they have filled the order and met their obligations.  If you order meat and don't get it, it's not their fault.  Avoid this location unless you have the time to pull over and check the order once you get it and have the extra time to wait in line again so they can fix it.  There's a Sprouts right behind them in the same parking lot.  Go there - they have prepared sandwiches ready to go.  This McDonalds should be embarrasses at how often they get drive through orders wrong!  I'm done with them!"}
{"text":"Okay, the 5 stars is for one thing and one thing only. My diet coke first thing in the morning. I don't know why McDonald's diet cokes are so good, but they are the best fountain cokes around.\n\nThis location is nice in the early mornings to get in and out. Be careful later in the day as the drive thru gets very congested due to the location."}
{"text":"I brought my iced coffee here for an exchange because it tasted bad. Sofia did everything she could to get it right. She made a new one, that didn't work, she offered to put more caramel. That didn't work, she offered a different kind. That didn't work. But the entire time, she didn't give me attitude or get annoyed with me because she had to keep remaking it. She even apoloigized. Hell it could've been me, but she said, it could be we need to remake the coffee.\n\nShe was very helpful - Thank you!"}
{"text":"I do love the quick service and delicious food.  McNuggets are my guilty pleasure.  Today, I went and ordered a large iced tea unsweetened at the drive thru.  Another bonus is the $1 drink.  However, the tea was not fresh.  It was gross and I threw it away.  Shame on you for not keeping fresh tea on hand on a hot day!"}
{"text":"The drive-thru is a motorists nightmare, so I hoisted my ass inside to get lunch. This has to be the friendliest McD ever. The employees don't just smile at customers, they smile at each other. Food was fast in spite of the place being packed. \nI'm a fan of the move able bench seats, too. If people have to wait, comfortable seating is an irrefutable kindness in a hard-chair world. \nThanks to the friendly smile and hot fries, I'd pass by other fast food placed to go back to this one."}
{"text":"Where to start?  First off, apparently the employees don't know the products they are selling.  I ordered the same thing I have ordered for the last year, and the drive through attendant told me they did not have the combo I was trying to order. I then informed them I had ordered the same thing just days earlier and they insisted the item didn't exist. I had to drive to the closest McDonald's where I ordered the same thing, and they were able to ring it up with no problem.  \nSecondly, at night time, this McDonald's has had me pull forward to the parking lot to wait for fries or nuggets.  Before pulling off, I specifically remind the attendant to include the BBQ sauce that I ordered.  I trusted that their memory span was long enough to remember the BBQ sauce when the fries or nuggets were finished within the 2-3 minutes they asked me to wait, but no, multiple times and multiple failures.  These employees want their wages to be $15/hr, they can't even remember to put some BBQ sauce in a bag after 2 minutes have passed. Not sure if it's mgmt, lack of attention to detail, or no respect for their customers, but I will no longer be visiting this restaurant because of the ongoing issues they seem to be having."}
{"text":"Another nightmare experience at the worst run McDonald's in Metro Phoenix.  I decided I wanted a small snack after leaving the gym. Ordered some nuggets and fries. With only three cars in front of me, and 20 MINUTES LATER, I finally got my cold nuggets, and cold fries...oh and the large fries I ordered was only filled half way, so I paid for a large and got a medium.\nThis store has turned the simplest of jobs into rocket science.  The lack of training here should be embarrassing to the management and staff.\nTrained chimpanzees would do a better job."}
{"text":"I love this location.  Everyone is really nice.  And the speed of the service is amazing.  You may be the 7th car in the drive-thru, but you will place your order, pay, and receive your food in 5 minutes.  Same goes for when you're inside.  There is limited seated inside, but there's usually not a long line and you get helped and served right away.  Right now I live within walking distance, but if I moved further away and there was another McDonald's that was closer to me, I would still go out of my way to go to this one."}
{"text":"I call it \"The Fast Lane\".  The kids who work the drive thru here always get it right, are incredibly fast, and unfailingly courteous - without overdone spiels or orchestrated upsells. This is the best of the new (technology, efficiency) combined with the best of the old (steady, hardworking kids, unburdened by consultants  keen on turning them into obnoxious 'sales associates'.)\n\nUnderstated, bedrock service.  Kudos to the mgr. Your guys and gals do a terrific job."}
{"text":"We politely asked the guy at the window to throw away our receipt, apparently that was too hard."}
{"text":"While the drive through service is great at this location, going in to eat was another story. Went in on Saturday around 2pm. The lady that took our order was not paying attention and was turned around talking in Spanish to what looked to be her manager the whole time. We held out our card for a while before she turned around to continue processing our order and really made us feel like we were bothering her. Everyone continued to goof around and speak only Spanish very loudly. I understand if there is no one inside but to continue to crack jokes/laugh in another language in front of guests is inappropriate. I will never go in to eat here again."}
{"text":"For fast food, list location is pretty nice. They get you in and out pretty quickly and I've never had a problem with the food. It also feels cleaner than most fast food restaurants I've been to. Maybe because it's a fairly newer location. My son would give it five stars because he loves their happy meals. I like their grilled chicken wraps a lot and their coffee is also very good. When I'm craving iced tea you can't beat their $1 pricing. Overall I'm a fan! As good as fast food can get!"}
{"text":"I've visited this McDonalds location very often. At times it can be very crowded and the drive thru line will move slow but service was great when I was there on Friday. I ordered fries and a strawberry lemonade. My fries were fresh and hot and they were not salty (which many people would complain about this but I greatly appreciated it). My strawberry lemonade had all of the strawberry syrup at the bottom of the cup which wasn't the greatest, but I easily mixed it in with the frozen lemonade and after that it was fine."}
{"text":"I ate hear about a month ago and I got sick. I had a double cheese burger, drink, and a pie. I believe it was the burger that made me sick. I has nauseous, sweating, stomach was pain, and kept going to the bathroom. It wasn't a stomach virus it felt like food poisoning. I haven't eaten at any McDonalds restaurant in over a month."}
{"text":"I ordered inside. The person that took my order was obviously VERY sick! Coughing and coughing! The sound of congestion and mucous in every breath and cough, disgusting! \n\nI ask the young man if l could speak with his Manager. He went and got his Manager. \n\nI said \" Good Morning\" to the manager, he looked at me as to say ' what do you want to bring me down with '.  I said \" good morning\" , again. This time I get a look from him like...I don't feel like being pleasant - what do you want!  I say \" good morning \" this last time and I get back \" morning' \" from the manager. \n\nI told the manager that I was not trying to get anyone in trouble and this has nothing to do with anything personal about the young man because he was very pleasant. My only concern was that \"the young man is obviously very congested and sounds bad and I'm not sure if he's sick. He actually make me not want to eat anything here.\" The manager said \" I will change his station\". I said \" oh...okay\" then he walked away. \n\nI personally don't think moving him to another station is a good idea but I said nothing. \n\nI noticed the young man was still helping take orders and was at the same register. I thought the manager did not seem to have concerns for the health of his patrons but a few moments later I saw the young man leaving with a car key in his hand. \n\nI guess the manager did care or maybe he told the  young man to go take a break. \n\n...\n...\n...\n\nI started this Review while I was still inside the Play area at McDonald's on my iPhone. I finished this review at a different McDonald's. \n\nThe thing is ...The Manager DID NOT take the young man off the floor but apparently told him to go take a break, thinking that I (the customer) would be gone soon. As I went up to get my refill of coffee, GUESS WHO TOOK AND KEPT MY COFFEE CUP. Yep... YIKES!!! ...SICKLY young man.\n\nI am sure I will NOT be frequenting this place maybe not even coming back.\n\nIs the Manager a LIER to Patrons or is he a good manager who tries to keep his Staff from missing hours and time for work or perhaps short handed on staff. Whatever the case, I WILL NOT be back.\n\nI'm not to sure, about this one."}
{"text":"It's bad enough that I caved in to a craving for McDonald's awful for you sweet and salty big breakfast with hotcakes, but they had to add insult to injury.\n\nMy order was missing the syrup for the hotcakes and the hashbrowns that are part of the meal. Not only that, but the scrambled eggs were barely cooked, there was no salt or pepper in the take out bag and they did not give me a receipt.\n\nThis must be my punishment for having even entertained the though to of eating McDonald's food. I won't make that mistake again, especially not from this location."}
{"text":"Went to this McDonalds because we were craving something sweet. Decided to go through the drive thru. HORRENDOUS SERVICE. My boyfriend asked for a chocolate chip frap (which was on the menu) and the woman says \"we don't have chocolate chip\" he responded with \"I'm sorry it says you do on the -\" she cut him off and practically yelled \"we don't have that\" Got to the window to get our stuff and the woman didn't say anything. Handed us our stuff and acted as if it were a huge inconvenience to get us some napkins. Only gave one star because we had to for the rating."}
{"text":"Drive thru is a joke !!! Sweet iced tea 1 cheese burger.  With in 2 minutes my son hurled. This mcd's needs  to expand let's size & lot. Get mgmt needs to step up."}
{"text":"5-stars for a fast food joint in a Casino food court?!?! Yup! We had McDonald's breakfast yesterday and today and everything was FANTASTIC! My husband went down yesterday and was back really quick and I volunteered to grab bfast today. LITERALLY NO LINE at 8am. I was expecting lines like 6-7 people deep. Nope! Our order came out at lightening-quick speed and I was back up to our room in about 5-8minutes TOPS! Of course the cost is a little more than a usual McDonald's but hey, it's to be expected. For (2) breakfast meals and (2) extra hash browns it came to $14.66. Much better than any of the breakfast buffets which charge at least $17/pp. Might go back again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I hate to admit that I am a lazy jerk who doesn't plan ahead and ends up here due to the fact it's convenient and somewhat cheap despite the fact the prices are 30% higher than your normal McDonalds.\n\nThe service is satisfactory for what it is, but it sometimes can get crowded-especially on Friday/ Saturday nights when the club crowd gets the munchies and they have difficulty deciding what to order due to their inebriated state."}
{"text":"Open 24/7. Came here for breakfast before a convention conference, the line was long but the service was great. Didn't have to wait too long for breakfast once the order was placed. Ordered Sausage McGriddle combo with hash brown and orange juice!\n\nLong lines ALL the time! Be prepared to wait a while and not know where the line starts/ends!"}
{"text":"This is a very busy Strip McDonald's in a food court. The prices are inflated. As far as service, it is okay. To be fair, if I were to rate the physical place I'd have to rate the Monte Carlo Food Court."}
{"text":"I was shocked by how rude the staff was. Especially coming from someone who seemed to be dressed (in blue) like a supervisor. While calling out a number 3 different times with no customer coming up Bernie, the supervisor, said \"he probably doesn't speak English\". I can see if you want to make a comment when no one is around, but he spoke this derogatory statement in front of a line of customers. It's completely unprofessional and rude."}
{"text":"This location is open 24 hours a day in the food court of the Monte Carlo.\n\nLines do not get too long and service is great.\n\nIt's the best feeling to walk back into the casino, partially inebriated, and just grab a burger and go up to my room."}
{"text":"Being in a casino \"food court,\" you'd expect the prices to be higher or outlandish here. Not the case with McDonald's. Prices aren't nearly as high as to what I would expect. Which was really a shocker, but in a positive way. We ventured here twice and both times the food was fresh and hot. It's one of the few affordable choices in this food court. This makes it a great place to pick up some McDonald's comfort food if your hotel is close such as the Monte Carlo itself, the Aria, Vdara or even the Cosmopolitan. I chose (4 stars) \"Yay! I'm a fan\" because I think that this is a convenient and affordable place. And, it's open 24/7, which is another positive!"}
{"text":"(This is the McD's inside the Monte Carlo food court)\n\nThis place gave me and 3 of my friends food poisoning!  After losing alot of money at roulette, I wanted to comfort myself with some good ol' fashioned greasy food from my childhood. \n\nBAD IDEA.  7 people sharing one bathroom, 4 of them sick.  DO NOT EAT HERE!!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas,. the only place with Spicy McChicken,.. my friends kept raving about how good the Spicy McChicken was; after a night of drinking throughout our whole trip,.... \n\nI just had to run to MCD before we caught the shuttle to the airport and ordered one before we caught our flight home,.. \n\nThey were right,..\n\nSpiceyyy ahhhhh"}
{"text":"located just steps away from the lobby of the Monte Carlo. Perfectly seasoned doubled cheeseburgers...thanks for a cheap vegas breakfast."}
{"text":"Breakfast was here as their Cafe is closed and there was a 25 minute wait at the Pub (which looked half empty, but maybe the lounge/bar section I was looking at was closed).\n\nIt was a solid, cheap breakfast (especially compared to some of the sky-high prices at places like Caesar's cafe).  I'm disappointed they don't give credit towards the mLife card though.\n\nThe vinyl seats of the food court chairs are cracked and look really bad."}
{"text":"Open after midnight on New Years, how awesome. All I really remember is the guy with the electronic pad to place orders, kind of like the in n out ones and picking up our fries and cheeseburgers and eating them upstairs in bed a few minutes later. YAY!"}
{"text":"I was totally shocked when I placed my order at this McDonald branch, this place has the worst customer service ever, I wonder who let these mean people run a McDonald branch, they better quit and find other jobs where they can practice their bad attitude without getting in touch with customers. Somebody gotta pay attention to how these ppl serve their customers!! Very rude."}
{"text":"Pro: Open 24/7, which makes it incredibly easy to get a bite to eat downstairs if you're staying at the Monte Carlo.\n\nCon: LINES.  So.many.people.all.the.time."}
{"text":"Had to stay standing for almost 10 minutes when all I wanted was a drink. There was no line, only a bunch of lazy employees chatting it up on the side while only one of their crew members was left calculating prices and working out the transactions by hand since none of their registers were working. +2 stars for the lady busting her ass and delivering great service at 1am. Should've caught her name."}
{"text":"The employees here are like headless chickens.  The manager was the leader of the headless chickens.  There were about six employees hanging out behind the counter, but only two were actually working.  Everyone lacked a sense of direction."}
{"text":"Dear Monte Carlo,\n\nI wanted to love you, I did. I read up on your website and I was interested in your centered strip location and your gorgeous pools, and you know what? THEY WERE!\n\nI never stay at the same hotel twice in Vegas, I decided to give you a try...\n\nMy fiance and I are so disappointed in your lack of customer service. There was a situation in YOUR food court area where a food court employee that goes by the name of NANCY RODRIGUEZ decided to have a personal dispute in the hotel and throw food at her boyfriend, which happened to land ALL OVER my fiance's SILK TOP. It was ketchup, and ketchup STAINS.\n\nAfter speaking to the front desk about the appalling situation and making a complaint we were told that  \"the food court has nothing to do with our hotel, you were at the wrong place at the wrong time\". No offers to clean the shirt, no apologies. We came here as a group of 20 whom paid for 6 seperate rooms and have brought plenty of business here and this is how it was handled!\n\nWe went back to the McDonalds Nancy Rodriguez worked for and complained to the manager about his employee's behavior at the hotel and how she has thrown food all over a PAYING GUEST! He then asked us \" What do you want me to do about it?\". You're the manager! You tell me what you are going to do!!!\n\nIn any case, with our luck Nancy Rodriguez decided to further her public dispute at the food court, which now consisted of 5 other people looking for a fight. I approached her angrily and told her \"Excuse me, when you decided to have food thrown at your boyfriend you covered my fiance with ketchup as well!\" She shrugged it off and stated \"(Sigh) Sorry\" and went back to her fight!\n\nThe Manager all the while just watched this without interfering! There was no HOTEL SECURITY breaking up this fight! An employee from HAAGEN DAS had to leave their booth and break it up!\n\nSorry, when I come to Vegas I like to have a little class and expect excellent customer service. This place just earned itself a terrible review. We are running back to you, Steve Wynn! Take all our money, we don't care! We want Monte Carlo burned down!"}
{"text":"I'm not here to review McDonald's food. It is what it is, love it or leave it. However, I've been to a lot of McDonald's over the course of my life, and this one stands head above all the others I've visited in the USA. I grab a bite here once every month or two. Whoever's running this particular location should be commended. The staff is always friendly, the food is consistent, and they've always get my order right. Great job to the managers and staff!"}
{"text":"Can you believe I only eat Mc'D's once in a year if that and I order and Bacon egg and cheese on a biscuit and I don't get the egg. How can that even be? I mean how hard is it to make the same breakfast sandwich and why would they think anyone would just want bacon and a piece of cheese on a biscuit.?"}
{"text":"It's a good McDonald's the people are real nice and friendly. I go there for breakfast it's nice"}
{"text":"We rarely ever eat fast food, but we stopped in here early Sunday morning after travelling.  Since it was sunday McD's was the only place open on exit 23 at 5:45 a.m.  The interior is fantastic,  fireplace, clean floors, modern, etc.  Our food was ready extremely quickly and the worker behind the counter was friendly.   They are doing a great job here.  The only deduction for a star was when we got home our english muffins were not toasted and tasting exceptionally fresh.  But that is really nit picking.  All in all one the nicest McDonalds I have been in. Great job."}
{"text":"I've never had a good experience at this McDonald's. I've had my drink given to me with no ice, small fries when I ordered large. I even had a burger with more katsup and mustard than meat  (literally ). Service is always slow. Employees are unfriendly, and seem to be put out when you ask for something."}
{"text":"This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to. Employees are lazy and food is never ready. Decor is nice but that don't matter. Revamp staff please !!"}
{"text":"Never seem to get it right.\n\nI've gone to this restaurant maybe half a dozen times over the years and there is always something wrong.\n\nWent through the drive through this morning to pick up a quick bit to eat and after we pulled away, we found that our order was wrong.  Had too much to do today other wise we would have gone back and besides, it's partly our fault because we did not check before pulling away.  At a reliable place, you should not have to but then again, I've had problems here before."}
{"text":"I guess there's no real point in reviewing a McDonald's. You know what to expect by now. However, this location (though aesthetically pleasing) is a customer service nightmare. \n\nI wouldn't write anything here unless it was REALLY bad. I mean ... it's McDonald's. We're not expecting 131 Main service here. But, it's REALLY bad! Trust me or you will suffer from wrong-order frustration. \n\nThere is a 90% chance they will get your order wrong. How do I know? Because we live around the corner and have been going here since it opened (not often, maybe once per month). And they get the order wrong pretty much every time. For instance...\n\nDuring our last visit, we went in to the restaurant (drive-thru line too long) and ordered my son a plain cheeseburger with nothing on it except cheese (that's how he likes it). We were foolish to drive away and expect to find the correct order at home. The label read on the bag read: \"No Onions.\" We never said anything about \"No Onions.\" We said, \"Nothing but a but a burger with cheese on it. Nothing else.\" How does that translate to a cheeseburger with pickles, ketchup, and mustard? \n\nThis type of thing has happened time and time and time again. Either the employees don't care about their jobs or they're not well trained. There's no other way around it."}
{"text":"I came through as the only car in the drive through lane to order dinner for my mom.  After placing the order and getting to the first window, I was greeted with only a total due (no \"hello\", no \"how are you?\", just the total).  Paid and went onto the 2nd window where I ended up waiting for a few minutes for my food.  No big deal if it has to be made, but at the same time I can see employees inside the restaurant basically playing around and goofing off.  With the volume of laughter and yelling, I can tell they weren't WORKING.  My food finally comes out and the young lady at the window was polite, apologized for the delay... but again as the window was closing, the loud shouting to co-workers continued.  Not something the public should have to hear, honestly.  Yes there can be fun times at work, but that's a bit excessive.\nThe food was typical McDonalds food.  Flat cheeseburgers that look nothing like the picture.  I do like this location because it's a cleaner restaurant than a lot of other locations."}
{"text":"The staff at this McDonald's is always friendly. The managers are very nice and always converse with my brothers and I whenever we visit. The reason for the three stars is because this McDonald's hours are just sad I guess you could say. I wish it was open later because the nearest twenty four hours McDonald's are either in Cornelius or by Northlake (both an equal drive) and sometimes the staff does not recognize coupons that are suppose to be accepted. But other than that, inside is always nice and neat and nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Absolute worst service I've ever had. I pulled into the drive through and an employee just says \"hello\". Not \"welcome to mcdonalds\". So I order my order, pay, and pull up to the window to pick up. Our order wasn't ready yet so we had to pull to the reserved lane. A woman walked out on her phone with my food. She handed me my food without looking at me and her eyes fixed on her phone. Then walked away without saying a word. Then to make it worse the bacon on my sandwich was burnt to the crisp. I won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"What is wrong with the left lane drive thru?  Are the cameras or alerts not working?\nI have been there 3 times, lately. I have had to yell to get someone to pay any attention and it did not always work.  I sat while the other lane was waited on and served, 3 customers to be exact.  Why can't the servers see who is outside and wait on them accordingly?\nI do not know the manager but if this continues to be poor service at the  drive thru, I will see the manager and call Corporate.  We helped to get the McDonalds in this area!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fast food guy, but, in a pinch to curb my appetite, this McDonald's was excellent. The drive through was very quick and the food was very good. The buns were fresh and the fries were hot and delicious. I was actually very impressed. Nice job Ronald!"}
{"text":"McDOnald's is McDonald's. Sometimes the wait in the drive through is ridiculous and you need to go into the restaurant. I have cone here after 11pm and they are closed...check the hours. Otherwise, the interior is very nice and the food is usually hot."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The wait is always so long. 10 minutes in line is a good day. 9 out of 10 times your order is wrong in the drive through.  Employees are not friendly and don't seem to understand the meaning of customer service.  This place needs a management overhaul. If you don't mind long waits and botched orders then this place is for you!!"}
{"text":"Cant really expect much from fast food.  But the incompetence in the drive thru of this particular Mcdonalds is beyond comparison.  It's as if I was speaking a different language.  \n\n  I wonder if they still actually have managerial positions at these type of restaurants or if it is just 15 yr olds running amuck...\n\n  Nothing on the order was right, when we asked for a receipt all we got was ... huh? And they parked us on the curb for ice cream cones.... \n\n  I know it sounds like I am just bitter and like in the lethal weapon movie with Joe Pesci I got effed in the drive thru.  But if this review makes someone laugh or inspires another victim to post their experience then my time has not been wasted.\n\nBuen Aprovecho! (Bon Appetite)"}
{"text":"This two star review is for the drive thru. There are two lanes and I was in the inner (left) lane. I chose this lane because there was a longer line in the right lane. Sort of a normal thing to do.\n\"All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me\nJust a Pepsi\"\nSorry, digressed to the lyrics of Suicidal Tendencies - Institutionalized. Actually I just wanted a Coke Zero but the premise is the same. So I ordered and waited. Waited for one of the cars in the outer lane to let me in. And they just kept driving in front of me. Seriously people. Especially the dude in the white truck. He wasn't even in line when I pulled up to the speaker to order yet I was hoping he would let me in. Nope. So I sort of pushed my way in behind him. \nThis system needs fixing because relying on the kind nature of people probably isn't going to work out that well.\nCrappy drive thru inner lane. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru and moved pretty quickly. Fries were nice and hot. A tad too much salt but still good.  Chicken nuggets were good as well. Considering I haven't had McDonald's in a long time, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"The drive-thru is pretty bad. Don't get the inside lane if there are lots of cars...one time at about 915pm they decided to stop taking orders w/o letting us know...the outside lane was moving fine. Plus, outside lane cars will block you in. Also, don't order a hot fudge sundae in drive-thru...they will give u chocolate sauce instead and hope u don't notice or say anything.  Blech. And they tend to get confused and get your order wrong.\n\n Going inside is much better. The playplace is painted with really interesting AZ desert paintings with lizards, snakes, geckos, etc enjoying McD's fare. 4 stars for inside...had to take 1 away for the bad multiple drive-thru experiences we have had."}
{"text":"As with most fast food joints, this McDonalds is hit or miss.  I'd say about half the time I get out with exactly what I ordered and no strange encounters.  \n\nThe most common problem I've had here is getting sauce for my nuggets.  They usually ask when I'm ordering, but I've learned to double check when I get my bag anyway.  Once, they distracted me from checking for sauce by failing to give me a straw.  I got my straw, forgot the sauce.  \n\nOn one visit, the girl at the second window made it through our entire exchange without actually speaking to me or looking at me.\n\nThe food is consistently typical McDonalds food, which isn't good, but it's what I go to get.  The line tends to move quick with the double ordering lines.  The location couldn't be more convenient to my house, which is probably not a good thing.  Overall, it is exactly what I expect and I know the subsequent stomach ache is my own fault."}
{"text":"Expect to wait for a really long time in the drive-thru, especially at night."}
{"text":"Filthy, filthy, filthy place. The dinning area had trash all over the place. The floor looks like is hasn't been mopped all week. I was afraid to sit down. They were returning people's money because they had been waiting over 20 mins for food!! Mine didn't take that long. All around just gross would never come here again."}
{"text":"Very horrible workers sating there argue with employees and customers about the food  u I'm never eating at this place gm  was trying to argue with me that my food was right employees were siting there eating food in front of the people and bathroom smells like shit people horse around in the bathroom screaming and yelling the f word and me and my friend to scream our order they keep saying what we ask for Big Mac they didn't give it to us"}
{"text":"So I dropped in for a quick lunch and a soda the other day with a friend of mine.  We just wanted something small.  So I ordered two chicken sandwiches and two cokes.  The girl said something that was not understandable and I said, \" What?  Say again?\"  -- she said something garbled again.  I really hate those establishments that hire people who cannot speak English.  I finally figured out she was saying \"do you want fries with that?\".  So I said fries with only one of them.  So she rang me up and pointed to the cash register readout that said $8.68.  So I paid.\n\nWhen they called my number, I got one sandwich, one small fries, and two small drinks.  I said that I ordered two sandwiches which the girl could not understand again.  So she had to call the Manager over and he told me that my order was for only one sandwich.  So I said, \"$8.68 for one small sandwich (not even a premium sandwich), small fries, and small coke?\".  So to get the other sandwich they charged me $4.90.  WTF??? Almost $14 for our snack/lunch?  Not only another example where you are better off going for a real lunch at places where you can get a lunch special for $5.99 or $6.99, and get good table service, and they have employees who can speak and comprehend the English language.  And even for fast food restaurants, JIB is better, cheaper, and higher in quality.\n\nI normally do not frequent MacDonalds because I always thought they sucked.  But this place was convenient to my cause the other day, but I will now never go back again."}
{"text":"They gave me extra fries and nuggets, their Mcspicys are pretty great but they have a little too much lettuce. Other than that their food is pretty good. 10/10 would eat agian"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had a decent experience at this location. The employees are so so bad. Borderline comical. I recommend going just for the experience."}
{"text":"No ice to purchase at this location, rude customer service no wonder why McDonald's is failing."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Took way too long for 2 hot chocolates.  Teenagers running the place.  Sad!"}
{"text":"Waited at the drive thru window for 5 minutes and received cold overlooked fries for my kids."}
{"text":"If I could give a lower star I would. The ice tea in the morning is not fresh it tastes like it was made the night before. The heavy set female manager in the morning is rude and will argue with the customers. My order was wrong and being in drive through with many cars behind me I just wanted her to fix it. She failed to give me whole order even after I gave her my receipt. She insisted I did not pay for what I ordered and told me \" it's just $2.15 more\". Then when I asked for my receipt back she lost it!!! I highly recommend driving past this place. Find a different location that will treat the customer with respect."}
{"text":"I don't expect too much from fast food places. This place doesn't do anything as far as going above and beyond, and nothing bad to earn a terrible rating. Food tastes the same like other McDonald's. They do a good job of getting my orders right."}
{"text":"Worst drive through experience ever... Let me start by saying I'm a chubby kid, I've eaten some McD's in my day. At this location I sat in line for 20 minutes, with only 3 cars ahead of me, only to receive some of the worst nuggets ever! My wife threw hers out before we got home, and I say to myself they can't be that bad, right?!? Wrong. I offered one to my dog, who, before today, had never talked. He looked me right in the face and said, \"Are you F'n kidding me with that?\"\n\nLong story short, it's so bad it will make your dog talk."}
{"text":"Service and tried and true menu is always just good. Crazy corner location is sometimes dufficult to navigate."}
{"text":"Hopeless and pathetic.... Every time we order icecream, they are out.... Fish burgers taste weird, and hot coffee is served warm.... They must have to improve standard in order to have more business. Total waste of money..."}
{"text":"As McDonalds go I suppose this is not much worse with product. I am constantly amazed at fast food joints lack of cleanliness and this place is no exception. Tables, floors, Seats...the list goes on."}
{"text":"You ask for UNSWEETENED tea, the gal repeated my order as she handed me my drink and I get SWEETENED. This isn't the first time. Frustrated to say the least."}
{"text":"When we pulled into the drive thru there was no cars in line. The guy asked us to hold. About 5 minutes later I said hello! And he asked what I wanted. I ordered a egg mcmuffin and a kids meal which took 20 minutes. When the guy gave us half our food he then asked if we wanted the other half! We then waited 5 more minutes for the rest of our order."}
{"text":"This McDonald's is BY FAR the worst McDonald's in Mesa. They are always short staffed so if you go there plan on a 15 to 20 minute wait. The service is terrible and the employees act like they cannot take another day there. Whoever runs this McDonald's needs to be fired! This is the 4th horrible experience I've had there in the last 2 weeks! I'm never going there again! I will go to gilbert and baseline where they are much more organized and treat you like a customer."}
{"text":"Waited to order my food at drive through once someone eventually answered I waited to pay. The employees were just playing around and not paying any attention.  So I went to the next window, thinking that other window might have been closed. I was wrong. Boyfriend started getting passed off for waiting so long that we just left without paying or getting food. The employees were just laughing and running around not attending to the customers..... Horrible service... It's sad too because I liked there food."}
{"text":"146 W Baseline Rd, Mesa, AZ 85210 Worst McDonald's I have ever been to! The only thing missing were cockroaches. I only trust this chain for breakfast and they couldn't even get that right. You try to call back to offer constructive criticism and they don't even answer the phone. I guess when you fleece millions of dollars defecating on your customers you can be that arrogant. Well, maybe that's why they are struggling. I can only hope the struggle is for a very long time."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru to get kids some mc nuggets last night. Ordered 40. When I got home each kid said they were shorted. 2 boxes with 8 and 2 boxes with 7. Shorted 10 in total. I called and after they let the phone ring for about 3-5 min, a manager named Mario picked up. I explained the situation and he said I could pick up the 10 missing. I was too tired to go back last night so he told me to go back sometime today and he would leave a note. So I stop by as I'm running errands and they won't give me the nuggets because Mario only left a note saying something to the effect that he has taken care of it and that I should come back again when Mario is there. I told them that not only was I not returning ever but that I would be doing this and they seemed fine with it. They can't be trusted to get your order right. Whatever they're getting paid is already too much. Bring on the kiosks."}
{"text":"If I could put a negative number of stars, it would be MINUS 100..... These people are sooooo stupid. We go there EVERY Thursday and EVERY Thursday, they mess it up. SO, I think, okay, I will have it all written down in both english AND spanish..... Guess what, they STILL can't get it right. I can honestly say that in the past 3 months, they got 1, yes ONE order correctly and we order the SAME thing every week. THEN you try and talk to them about it and they cop an attitude and then it just gets worst. SO, next week, I am going to order 1 think at a time and then pay, then order the next thing and let them know that until we go through the 7 items on my list, and make sure all is correct, I will not batch it. I mean, cmon people, are you REALLY that STUPID....."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't even have to put a star worst McDonalds I have ever been to!!! Ordered 3 things and all were wrong then wanted to charge me more to fix it!!! Are you freaking kidding me!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the new McDonalds next to the Wal-Mart at Baseline and Country Club/Az Ave.  There's not much to say about it other than it seems to replace the indoor McDonald's that used to be in the store.  I'm no longer a McDonald's fan, haven't been for years, but I do stop by for their cheap iced coffee on a hot day occasionally.  It's only a dollar for the regular and $2 for the tall.  I just wish they would use a sturdier glass for the tall.  I always fear the lid will pop off when I lift it up to take a sip, especially in the car."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give it one star. Showed up tonight 11:05pm and they don't close until midnight just to grab a couple burgers sad at the drive-through for 10 minutes and nobody answered. I think if you're open until 12am  you should be open.. Worst customer service .. Don't waste your time.. Not the first time it has happened.. It's also happened at 8pm at night and no one was in line.. Complete BS"}
{"text":"I have been a Fan of Micky D's for years. I enjoy this Micky D's over others as the workers are friendly and for it only being  approx. 6 months old it is kept fairly clean."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times because I work close and I haven't had anything good here except a spicey mc chicken once. The wait is excessive, multiple times my orders have been cold and once I tried their breakfast and I am pretty sure that if I had eaten the sausage it would have made me sick. I may try it again someday as these things happen but not any time soon."}
{"text":"Worst McDonald's I've ever been to.. Sat in line for 25 minutes one evening and workers weren't even apologetic. Watched a woman manager embarrass and harass a worker this morning 8/10/15 they always get orders wrong just save yourself the time and go to another one"}
{"text":"This place was a disaster when I walked in. Completely unprofessional behavior and a dirty store. Every single table was dirty and the soda area was a mess. Straw wrappers all over the floor and dried spills covered the entire lobby. Food was old tasting, the tray mat was dirty when given to me, there were 5 or 6 people working, not busy inside and a small amount in the drive thru. Employees walked around aimlessly, hard to believe with the amount of work needed to be done. Manager on duty had no authority and crew had no respect for him. I also heard a crew member say she was not going to sweep but \"sweep mop.\" I worked for dunkin donuts for nearly two years, I understand that fast food is not an ideal profession, but should still be taken seriously. You are adults and should not be behaving like children. Stop whining about your job, if you don't like it, get a new one."}
{"text":"The food is good. The staff play around too much.\n\nThe drive thru cannot hear me, act like they know me, and one drive-thru worker screamed into the speaker. \n\n\nI heard McDonald's treats their employees well and pays generously. They're known for taking people on food stamps and getting them a better life."}
{"text":"Rarely am I moved nor inspired to write anything about a ubiquitous fast food chain, such as McDonald's. However, I just wanted to highlight an encounter with an above average and atypical employee, whose actions were particularly noteworthy.\n\nA normal Sunday afternoon drive brings me to the northern part of Phoenix. I wanted a quick bite to eat, without all the delays associated with a restaurant. I happen to spot this Mcdonald's and it happened to be on the right side of the street on my way to another destination. \n\nI purposed to just have an expeditious meal; so I parked my car and went inside. In front of me was a large group of people that appeared to be struggling with the menu selection and the costs of the meals.\n\nWhile waiting patiently in line, I engaged in conversation the diligent employee next to me who was mopping the floor, She really performed her job with gusto! I commented on the great job she was doing. We also equally lamented the lack of originality and creativeness associated with the songs that we were hearing on the overhead speakers. However, our conversation kicked into gear when a song that we both liked started playing.\n\nWithout any prompting whatsoever, she put her mop and bucket out of the way towards the side, and opened a register just to take my order! In spite of her busyness, and our conversation, she was adept enough in noticing that little progress was being made in the ordering process by the group in front of me.\n\nIn a nutshell, I got my order in, and I was out of there in under 10 minutes - which was my intent this whole time. If it weren't for this employee's recognition and take charge attitude, I'd still be stuck in line having enough time to ponder the meaning of Life, The Universe, and Everything!\n\nSo, this is my Shout-Out to Vaneesha for an exceptional effort in customer service. No one may ever read this review, but if she happens to; she will know that her efforts did not go unnoticed - even by a complete stranger.\n\nFast food may be a thankless job, but that kind of continued exemplary customer service and attitude goes a long way to pave the road for success.\n\nI should know, as I used to work a long time ago in Wendy's mopping floors just like her!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service!!!! The drive thru is not only slow, but Ariana the lady working drive thru tonight didn't say a word to me as she only took my money and gave me my smoothie. Not even a simple \"thank you\". So I (sarcastically) said \"You're welcome!!\" And her response was (with an attitude) \"I don't have to say thank-you to nobody\". I tried calling the store to complain about her attitude & the store manager Josh did nothing but argue with me & REFUSED to give me corporates number. Absolutely ridiculous. Never going there again.  Doesn't even deserve one star."}
{"text":"Oh my, such a terrible experience. I understand that it is McDonald's, so I didn't go into the situation with that high of expectations...but this was bad. We went through the drive-through at 9 PM to order a cup of coffee and a regular iced coffee. We were directed to the window to order because our order was \"confusing\". No problem! Get the regular cup of coffee (hot) and it is cold....as in sitting on the counter cold. I almost let it go because it's just a  crappy cup of coffee, but my husband ran in. When he walked in, the timer on the coffee pot said 5 PM. He told the manager that the coffee was cold and the manager threw her head back and said, \"Do you really want to wait for another cup of coffee\". My husband said he almost walked out but decided to wait just on principle. The manager never apologized and was insanely rude and acted like we were putting them out by asking for a cup of coffee that was hot...not brewed four hours ago. I was pretty turned off by this. Again, it's McDonald's so I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but McDonald's usually at least has somewhat friendly employees and hot food. I agree with the other reviews that management needs to take a look at this place."}
{"text":"Must be the most profitable McDonalds on the planet because they routinely cheat you out of stuff you ordered at the drive-through. And when you call they are nasty to you."}
{"text":"So it's just a McDonald's.  So what?  Well, unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) the are not all created equal.  I have been to this location several times.  The staff is friendly for a McDonald's, but I would say it takes roughly twice as long to get my food as it does at other locations.  I don't think I have ever received my food where there wasn't at least something left off of my tray, like a drink, or french fries.  There are so many McDonald's to choose from surrounding this one, I might keep on driving an extra mile or so and visit another location."}
{"text":"I've never been inclined to write a review about a fast food chain but the service was exceptional! Staff Lois was so personable and friendly! The lobby was spotless!! We waited a little longer for food and Lois made sure we were taken care of!"}
{"text":"The drive through time really depends on the time of day.  Sometimes it's very fast other times not so much. I usually am happy with my orders here."}
{"text":"Let's face it, McDonald's isn't exactly gourmet fast food, but at least it's fast, right? Wrong! This location blows. The drive thru is unbelievably slow. Worse, I'm not sure what I just ate; the first bite of that Egg McMuffin tasted like dish soap, and it was cold! I might also make one suggestion. It might behoove the owner/operator to have a person who speaks English working the drive thru."}
{"text":"Best McDonald's experience I've ever had. The service was awesome, Lois is the best McDonald's employee I have ever encountered. My food was taking a while and she made sure I was taken care of. :)"}
{"text":"I know this is a late night run,  but the wait here is crazy!! I would've gone to another location had one been available."}
{"text":"Fast drive-thru, slow service inside.  Hardly any counterspace inside, as though they really just have this place for the drive thru customers.  Food same as any other McDonalds."}
{"text":"This is the worst Mcdonalds ever the manger looks like a fucking creep and there service is slow... They forgot my ranch and made my plain Mcdouble with extra ketchup."}
{"text":"Very slow drivethru it was about 10 pm on Thursday August 28th 2014 .  Waited then got home and frys were all hard and cold , short drive home."}
{"text":"This cracked me up so I simply had to document it! 9:30ish (pm) and wanted nuggets. My wife reluctantly comes with me to the drive through. I order my 10 piece and she decided to get a parfait. My wife likes granola- well known fact. She asks if there is any way she could get an additional packet of their nature valley granola to top of her yogurt and the lady on the other side of the speaker says, \"no\". Flat out, didn't even pause lol. My wife is bewildered and looks at me for some type of assurance she is still in a conscience state. Now by this time I am laughing so hard I think I had tears on my cheeks, couldn't even breath. I managed to replay to her statement with the question \"can I pay for additional granola\"? Someone in the place must have heard because another ladies voice came in giggling, trying to hide it, professionally, and said that it wasn't a problem. We ended up with about five packets of granola. No harm, no foul, super funny"}
{"text":"It's a regular McDonalds  the people are nice and as far as how they treat you and they're pretty quick about getting my food so that's what expect"}
{"text":"Well after a long 14 HR. Day at work I wanted to grab something fast and easy...  well not fast at all in fact a little over 10 min just to get too the food.  I can handle that. But when I went home too eat my food there was hair.  I called the manager to confront her about it...  the answer I got was I don't know how that happened. We don't have anyone with long hair working the grill. I was offered to have the food remade but between the wait,  hair,  and being questioned. I don't want it remade...  I feel bad giving this place one star"}
