{"text":"I tried to give this McD a second chance but I have to agree with other reviewers: this mcD is awful. The person at the Drive-through never understands what you're ordering so you end up yelling at the speaker several times to get your order in, just to have the wrong thing given to you anyhow. \n\nToday we waited 15 min between placing our order and receiving it and found out when we got home that we go two boy happy meal toys for our two daughters. Also forgot the BBQ sauce. Fail."}
{"text":"Service is meh... \nPlace is too busy at prime time due to the kids in the area for the community centre/library/ice rink/school.\n\nThe reason i said that the service is meh is i usually order coffee with a muffin, sometimes 2 of these.\nOne time, i waited 5 mins for this..\nOne time the coffee tasted too strong, and there were coffee grinds at the bottom of my cup.\nI think they are understaffed. No one walks around to wipe/clean the tables.\nThe condiments section is always messy.\n\nNot very happy when coming here... \n2.5 stars for my last few visits."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worse managed. Their washroom was filthy. Service is very rude and when you order a few combos and someone wants a water,  they are charged a dollar for a cup \"due to the dollar drink days. .. they do not provide water to patrons\" was the official line. If they were not locacared inside a community centre. I would not expect this type of management to last very long"}
{"text":"The food is good here. The service not so much. The mainlanders who hang out here make everything even worse with their screaming demons running around and climbing on everything."}
