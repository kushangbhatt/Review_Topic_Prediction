Review Topic Prediction

Yelp dataset has restaurant reviews which describe the customer demand, preferences and their like dislike. 

Topic modeling can help us to find latent subtopic from these reviews. 

These topics can help us to get insight to restaurant about what customer care about and how to increase rating which directly affect to business revenue. 

The goal is to extract topics from a large reviews corpus and then predict the topic distribution for a new unseen review. 

To find latent subtopics from reviews I use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm, a generative probabilistic model.
